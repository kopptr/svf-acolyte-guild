# SVF Acolyte Guild Handbook Website

This repo holds all of the contents of the guild handbook website. Initial
configuration was done using the template from
[jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs).

## Usage
The simplest way to modify the contents of the handbook is to use
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to open this repo as a vault, update the
contents, and then commit and push the changes with `git`.

## Guidelines
You can submit pull requests to have your changes published. If you would like
to preview your changes, you can set up your own copy of the handbook by
configuring your clone using the instructions in
[jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs).
