## Liturgical Actions

## Common mistakes and pitfalls
- Attempting to hand the [[Deacon]] the [[Thurible]] after charging it during the Gospel Procession.
- Stepping forward to receive the [[Thurible]] after the [[Celebrant]] has incensed the [[Altar]] during the Offertory, instead of waiting for the [[Deacon]] to incense the [[Celebrant]], [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]], and [[Congregation]].
- If no [[Deacon]] is present, forgetting to incense the [[Celebrant]], [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]], and [[Congregation]] after the [[Celebrant]] incenses the [[Altar]] during the Offertory.
- Forgetting to add more charcoal to the [[Thurible]] at appropriate times, especially during the Homily.
- Not carrying the [[Thurible]] high enough, resulting in it swinging into the ground or a step.
