In a [[Mass]] celebrated _ad orientum_ in either rite, to move to or from a side of the [[Altar]] to the other side or to the center of the foot of the [[Altar]]. This is done without ascending the [[Altar]] steps. So called because the path taken from one side to the other forms a U shape.

If the path crosses the center of the [[Altar]], the [[Altar Server|Server]] should stop to [[Reverence]] in the middle. [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] if the Eucharist is reposed (as is typical at the [[High Altar]]), [[Moderate Inclination|Moderate Bow]] if not (as is typical at the [[Rosary Altar]]).
