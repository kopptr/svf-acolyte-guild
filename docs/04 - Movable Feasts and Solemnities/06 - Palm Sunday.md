## Sext
At [[Saint Catherine of Siena Church]].

- Process into the [[Sanctuary]], using the standard [[Procession#Formation]].
	- North from the [[Sacristy]] across the front of the church.
	- Form up at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]], [[Reverence]], and enter. There will not be enough room for all to form up, so the [[Altar Server|Servers]] should do this in separate parts.
- [[Lucifer]] 3, [[Crucifer]], and [[Lucifer]] 4 sit at the [[Sedilia]], setting down the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] and resting the [[Processional Crucifix]] on the ground where appropriate.
- Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] sit in [[Choir Stalls]] on the Epistle side.
- Stand and sit at appropriate times with congregation. Follow the pamphlet.
- When _Sext_ is finished, servers retrieve needed items and start procession.
	- **Cue**: _Let us bless the Lord_. **Thanks be to God.**

## Solemn Procession
The First Form of the Procession given in [[The Roman Missal]] is used.

Process out of the [[Sanctuary]] down the middle aisle to the back of the church where there is a lectern, not stopping to reverence. No incense is imposed before this procession.

Form up:

- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] split to the North and form up facing the middle.
- [[Lucifer]] 3, [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer]] 4 split to the South and form up facing the middle.
- [[Book Bearer]], [[Holy Water Bearer]], and any extra [[Altar Server|Servers]] split to the South and form up behind the [[Processional Crucifix]] facing the middle.

### Blessing of Palms
- When [[Celebrant]] finishes the introduction and text of the blessing of palms, [[Holy Water Bearer]] attends to the [[Celebrant]] while he sprinkles Holy Water, following him and holding the [[Aspersorium]] and his [[Cope]] on his right side.
- When finished, [[Holy Water Bearer]] sets down [[Aspersorium]] in its place, grabs enough palms for himself, the [[Book Bearer]], and any empty-handed [[Altar Server|Servers]], and returns to formation.

### Gospel, (Homily)
- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] approach [[Celebrant]] to charge incense, or [[Boat Bearer]] gives boat to [[Thurifer]] if there is not enough space.
- After [[Deacon]]'s blessing, [[Thurifer]] precedes [[Deacon]] to the lectern[^no_deacon], [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] 3 and 4 approach the lectern and flank it, and [[Holy Water Bearer]] gives [[Celebrant]] a palm.
	- [[Thurifer]] attends to [[Deacon]] for the _Gospel_. 
	- After _Gospel_, all return to formation.
	- A [[Altar Server|Server]] gives the [[Deacon]] a palm.
- Priest may optionally preach a homily.

[^no_deacon]: If there is no [[Deacon]], then they precede the [[Celebrant]] or [[Concelebrant]], and there will be no blessing, as is typical at [[Mass]].
