## Order of Liturgy

### Entrance
All [[Altar Server|Servers]] except [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] start in [[Choir Stalls#Low]].

- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]], empty-handed, clap the [[Crotalus]] and precede the [[Minister|Ministers]] through the [[Lourde's Door]] and proceed directly to the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].
- Form up at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]]: [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1, [[Priest]], [[Deacon]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 2.
- The [[Minister|Ministers]] prostrate, and the [[Altar Server|Servers]] and people kneel while they do so.
- The [[Minister|Ministers]] and [[Altar Server|Servers]] stand, [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]], and enter the [[Sanctuary]].

### Opening Prayers
[[Book Bearer]] attends with [[Missal]] immediately for the whole opening sequence.

### Readings, Gradual, Tract, Gospel, Homily
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:

- There is no _Gospel Procession_, using neither [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] nor incense.
- During the _Tract_, the [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] places the [[Hockey Puck Mic]] on the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]], unmutes it, and returns to his [[Choir Stalls|Choir Stall]].
- All kneel at the appropriate time during the _Gospel_.
- When the _Gospel_ is finished, an the [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] mutes the [[Hockey Puck Mic]] and returns it to the [[Credence Table]].

### Solemn Intercessions
- [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Missal]] for the _Solemn Intercessions_, which the [[Priest]] reads at his seat, and another friar reads from the Gospel side lectern.
- All [[Altar Server|Servers]], except the [[Book Bearer]], kneel/stand at _Let us kneel_/_Let us stand_. [[Book Bearer]] steps back at these times to allow the [[Priest]] and [[Deacon]] to kneel, then steps forward again when they stand.

### Adoration of the Holy Cross
Immediately following the [[#Solemn Intercessions]]:

- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]]:
	- **Take off shoes**, leaving them in the [[Choir Stalls]].
	- Go to the [[Sacristy]] with [[Minister|Ministers]] by way of the [[Passageway]], making a [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] along the way.
	- Light and carry the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]].
- All other [[Altar Server|Servers]]:
	- Remain in [[Choir Stalls#Low]] and **remove shoes**. Leave shoes in [[Choir Stalls]].

#### Procession
[[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank [[Veneration Crucifix]], carried by a friar, with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]].

- Order:
	- Cantors.
	- [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1, [[Processional Crucifix]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 2.
	- Attending friar.
- Route: Three stops. At each, _Behold the wood of the cross_ / **Come let us adore him**.
	1. Process from [[Lourde's Door]] to foot of the [[Friars' Chapel]].
	2. Process to the middle of the [[Sanctuary]], centered between the [[Choir Stalls]] on the black strip of flooring near the West edge of the [[Choir Stalls]].
	3. Process into the [[Presbytery]] and stop just after the top step, on the floor of the [[Presbytery]].
- At each stop, the [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]]:
	- Leave room on either side of the [[Veneration Crucifix]] for the attending friar to partially unveil it.
	- Turn inward and face the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- [[Priest]] stands on the steps of the [[Presbytery]] holding the [[Veneration Crucifix]]. [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank him, turned inward, with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]], where they stand for the duration of the [[#Friars' Veneration]].

#### Friars' Veneration
Friars venerate the [[Veneration Crucifix]] sequentially, making three [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] along the way. All [[Altar Server|Servers]] other than [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] standby, seated in the [[Choir Stalls]].

- First friar starts in [[Sanctuary]] close to the people, and performs a [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]]  on the first square, facing the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- First friar moves to middle of [[Sanctuary]], second friar fills in his place. All friars time their genuflection and movement together.
- First friar to the [[Veneration Crucifix]], second friar fills in first friar's place, third friar fills in second friar's place. All three make [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] together, the first kissing the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- First friar turns outward and files back to the [[Choir Stalls]], fourth friar moves in, and so on.

#### Peoples' Veneration
Begins after the last friar has venerated the [[Veneration Crucifix]].

- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] 1 and 2 take up [[Purificator|Purificators]].
- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]], [[Book Bearer]], and [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] go to foot of the [[Sanctuary]], preceding the [[Veneration Crucifix]]. Line up in pairs, [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] first.
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank [[Veneration Crucifix]] with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] as [[Priest]] processes with it, down to the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] place the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] to either side of the [[Veneration Crucifix]], on the [[Sanctuary]] step the crucifix is resting on. Leave plenty of space for a person to stand on either side.
- All [[Altar Server|Servers]] venerate in pairs, demonstrating to the people how to do it. [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] stand on either side of the [[Veneration Crucifix]] when done, and wipe for all the people.
- Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] direct traffic:
	- For the North line: [[Rosary Altar]] pews go first, then North section of main pews. Chairs file through the pews.
	- For the South line: Side-facing pews go first, followed by [[Friars' Chapel]] pews, followed by the South section of main pews. Those in the section of pews near the confessionals file through the main aisle pews.
	- Station one server for North side, one for South side, one for front of main aisle, and one for back of main aisle.
- When veneration is almost complete, [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] retrieves the bracket and sets it on the center tile in front of the [[Crossing Altar]].
- When finished, the [[Priest]] places the [[Veneration Crucifix]] in it, and the [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] set the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] on either side of it.
- All return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]] and don shoes.

### Communion
Transition seamlessly into _Communion_ - there will be no action from the [[Celebrant]] or change in music.

	- Form up and [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] with the [[Deacon]].
	- [[Humeral Veil Bearer]] assists [[Deacon]] with the [[Humeral Veil]], then [[Genuflection|Genuflects]] and moves to the North part of the [[Rosary Altar]] area.
	- When the [[Deacon]] has the Eucharist and turns, [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] precede him to the [[Crossing Altar]]. [[Humeral Veil Bearer]] remains kneeling until Eucharist is gone.
	- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]]:
		- Upon approaching the [[Crossing Altar]], stand on either side of it and face inward.
		- When the Eucharist is placed on the [[Corporal]], place candles on the [[Crossing Altar]], [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] together facing inward, and return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]].

		- Fold and take the [[Corporal]] and [[Tabernacle]] key, and deposit them on the [[Credence Table]].

	- Return to [[Choir Stalls]].
- Meanwhile, [[Priest|Priests]] retrieve more Eucharist from the [[Sacristy]].
- All return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]].
- After the [[Priest]] receives communion, receive communion in two lines, letting the friars receive first. No bell is run nor [[Crotalus]] clapped.
- After communion, a [[Minister]] takes the Eucharist to the back of the [[Tabernacle]] in the [[Sacristy]].
- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] assist with purification of vessels, bringing water cruet **and clean [[Purificator]]** (as the [[Celebrant]] does not have one).
- After the [[Celebrant]] drinks the water from a [[Ciborium]]:
	- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] take the [[Burse]] to the [[Crossing Altar]], fold up and put away the [[Corporal]], and then put them back on the [[Credence Table]].
	- An [[Acolyte]] mutes the [[Hockey Puck Mic]] and returns it to the [[Credence Table]].
	- [[Book Bearer]] takes the [[Missal]] and [[Missal Stand|Stand]] back to the [[Choir Stalls]].
	- **The altar cloth and lit candles are left on the [[Altar]]**.

### Prayer after Communion and Prayer over the People
[[Book Bearer]] bears [[Missal]].

### Recession
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]], empty-handed, form up at the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]] with [[Minister|Ministers]]. All four **[[Genuflection|Genuflect]]** to the [[Veneration Crucifix]], and then [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] precede them to the [[Sacristy]] by way of the [[Lourde's Door]].
- All other [[Altar Server|Servers]] remain in [[Choir Stalls]]. They exit through the [[Passageway]] after the friars and choir have exited.

## Cleanup
- [[Veneration Crucifix]] in bracket and two lit [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] remain.
- Two [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] from the [[Crossing Altar]] move by the [[Veneration Crucifix]], so as to make a "V".
- Altar cloth folded and brought back to [[Sacristy]].
