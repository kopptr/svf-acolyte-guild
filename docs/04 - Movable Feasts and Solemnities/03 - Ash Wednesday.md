- _Penitential Rite_ and [[Kyrie]] omitted.

This is one of three weekday solemnities that are celebrated at the [[Crossing Altar]], the others being [[12-25 - Christmas|Christmas]] and [[02-02 - Candlemas|Candlemas]].

## Preparation
The [[Credence Table]] may be crowded, using a second table (#todo from where?) is recommended.

- [ ] [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Preparation]].
- [ ] [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Preparation]].
- [ ] [[Benediction#Preparation]].
- [ ] [[Credence Table]]:
	- [ ] [[Aspersorium]].
	- [ ] Ashes.
	- [ ] Clorox wipes (for cleaning ashes off of [[Minister|Ministers]]' hands). Alternatively, lemon and bread.

## Order of Mass
[[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Order of Mass]], except:

- No _Penitential Rite_ or [[Kyrie]].
- Immediately following the _Homily_, the [[#Blessing and Imposition of Ashes]].
- Preparations for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament]] during the [[Ablutions]].

### Procession
[[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Entrance]].

### Collect
The _Penitential Rite_ and [[Kyrie]] are omitted (and there is no [[Gloria]] since it is [[Lent]]), so after the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] is incense the [[Book Bearer]] immediately attends with the [[Missal]] for the [[Collect]].

### First Reading through Homily
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]].

### Blessing and Imposition of Ashes
- The [[Book Bearer]] approaches the [[Celebrant]] with the [[Missal]], the [[Celebrant]] says the blessing. The [[Book Bearer]] places the [[Missal]] on the [[Choir Stalls]] and lines up to receive ashes.
- As the [[Celebrant]] sprinkles the ashes with Holy Water, the other [[Altar Server|Servers]] line up for ashes with the [[Book Bearer]].
- After receiving ashes, the [[Altar Server|Servers]] return to the [[Choir Stalls]].
- The [[Minister|Ministers]] impose ashes on the people. Upon their return, a [[Altar Server|Server]] assists with cleaning their hands as needed.

### Offertory through Peoples' Communion
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]]. The [[Credo]] is not said, and the [[Universal Prayer]] is omitted. The [[Thurifer]] should add charcoal during Communion.

### Ablutions
- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] and [[Book Bearer]] perform [[Ablutions]], and set the altar for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament]].
- [[Thurifer]] moves the [[Thurible Stand]] to the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]] on the Epistle Side.
- When finished, all return to [[Choir Stalls]].

### Postcommunion prayer and transition
- The [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Missal]]. The [[Thurifer]] stands by next to the [[Celebrant]] facing North.
- When finished, the [[Book Bearer]] returns to [[Choir Stalls]], the [[Thurifer]] precedes the [[Celebrant]] to the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]], as at [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Transition]].

## Exposition
- [[Thurifer]] acts as usual for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]], starting from [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Incensation]].
- Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] standby in the [[Choir Stalls]], kneeling as appropriate.
- When [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]] is finished, the [[Thurifer]] precedes the [[Celebrant]] out of the church through the [[Lourde's Door]].
- The other [[Altar Server|Servers]] discreetly [[Reverence]] the exposed Eucharist and exit to the [[Sacristy]] through the [[Passageway]].

## Benediction
After the Holy Hour, a [[Altar Server|Server]] acts as [[Thurifer]] for [[Benediction]], as usual.
