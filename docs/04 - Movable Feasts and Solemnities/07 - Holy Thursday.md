	- **Cue**: End of _Gloria in excelsis Deo_, and [[Schola Cantorum]] starts singing.
- Stop ringing:
	- **Cue**: End of _et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis_. Also, the back organ will come in very loudly.
- Silence until the next cue.
- Start ringing:
	- **Cue**: End of _Quoniam tu solus Sanctus_, again, the back organ will come in very loudly.
- Continue Ringing bells all the way through the end of the _Gloria_, through the end of the _Amen_ at the end of it, then stop.

- Remove altar cloths, altar crucifix, and candles.
	- **The linen on top of the [[Crossing Altar]] gets rolled up, not folded.**
