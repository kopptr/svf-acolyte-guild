## Order of Mass

### Entrance
Mass will start when everyone is in place near the firepit on 66th Street near the [[Rosary Altar]] entrance. All of the [[Altar Server|Servers]], [[Minister|Ministers]], and [[Schola Cantorum]] should go there in an orderly fashion, holding what they need for the [[#Lucernarium]]:

- [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] is empty-handed.
- [[Thurifer]] has **unlit** [[Thurible]] with charcoal and [[Incense Boat]].
- [[Ignifer]] 1 has short [[Taper]].
- [[Ignifer]] 2 has weenie roaster and tongs.
- [[Book Bearer]] bears [[Missal]] and carries it in procession.
- A [[Priest]], not the [[Celebrant]], carries the [[Paschal Candle]].
- Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] carry [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]], plus four extra [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] between them, one each for [[Celebrant]], [[Deacon]], [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]], and [[Ignifer]] 2.

Form up:

- [[Book Bearer]] and [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] near [[Celebrant]].
- [[Thurifer]], and [[Ignifer|Ignifers]] 1 and 2 with an easy path to the fire.
- Everyone else in two lines out of the way.

### Lucernarium
_Service of Light_.

Mass begins when the [[Celebrant]] starts the prayers.

#### Blessing of Fire and Preparation of the Candle
- [[Book Bearer]] holds [[Missal]] for the lighting and blessing of the fire and the preparation of the [[Paschal Candle]].
- After the fire is lit and blessed[^charcoal_timing], and the preparation of the [[Paschal Candle]] is taking place, [[Thurifer]] and [[Ignifer]] 2 **discreetly** light [[Thurible]]:
	- Both approach the fire. [[Thurifer]] holds [[Thurible]] open.
	- [[Ignifer]] 2 uses tongs/weenie roaster to take charcoal brickettes from [[Thurible]], light them in the fire, and place them back in the [[Thurible]].
	- When finished, [[Thurifer]] closes [[Thurible]] and [[Ignifer]] 2 leaves the weenie roaster and pockets the tongs. Both return to their place.
- [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] provides the [[Celebrant]] with the stylus, incense grains, and follower as the [[Paschal Candle]] is being prepared.
- When the preparation of the [[Paschal Candle]] is finished, [[Ignifer]] 1 lights the [[Taper]] from the fire and hands it to the [[Celebrant]]. [[Celebrant]] lights the [[Paschal Candle]] and hands the [[Taper]] back, which [[Ignifer]] 1 extinguishes.

[^charcoal_timing]: [[The Roman Missal]] says not to do this until the [[Paschal Candle]] is lit, but if we do that, then the coals won't be properly lit for the procession.

#### Procession
- [[Thurifer]] goes to [[Celebrant]] to impose incense.
- [[Ignifer]] 1 gives [[Taper]] to [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]].
- [[Ignifer|Ignifers]] give extra [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] to [[Ignifer|Ignifers]] 1 and 2, [[Celebrant]], and [[Deacon]].
- **Formation**:
	- [[Thurifer]]
	- [[Priest]] with [[Paschal Candle]].
	- [[Celebrant]].
	- [[Master of Ceremonies]].
	- [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]].
	- [[Altar Server|Servers]] in pairs. [[Ignifer|Ignifers]] first, [[Book Bearer]] last.
	- [[Schola Cantorum]].
- **Route**: Three legs, each stopping for _Christ our light_/**Thanks be to God**:
	1. Just outside the door on the corner of Lexington Ave. and 66th St.
		- [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] lights [[Taper]] from [[Paschal Candle]], lights the [[Celebrant]]'s candle, and extinguishes the [[Taper]].
	2. Into the narthex, into the nave, up the main aisle to the halfway point.
		- [[Celebrant]] lights the [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]]'s [[Taper]], who shares the flame with [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]], [[Altar Server|Server]], and [[Schola Cantorum]], who then pass it to the people.
	3. To the foot of the [[Sanctuary]]. [[Thurifer]] stands off to the North side during intonation.
		- [[Paschal Candle]] goes to its stand in front of the [[Ambo]]. [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] accompanies it to spot as it's placed, then returns to his seat.
		- Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] enter the [[Sanctuary]] in pairs, forming up in the middle and making a [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] before entering and going up the North side of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]]:
			- [[Thurifer]] goes to the [[Celebrant]]'s chair and stands by.
			- [[Ignifer]] 3 goes to the [[Sacristy]] by way of the [[Passageway]], and waits near the [[Lourde's Door]] (so that he can hear).
			- All others deposit their items and stand in [[Choir Stalls#Low]] with lit [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]].

#### Exsultet
- [[Thurifer]] assists with [[Imposition of Incense]]. [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] holds [[Celebrant]]'s and [[Deacon]]'s [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] during imposition of incense.
- [[Thurifer]] then precedes whomever will proclaim the [[#Exsultet]]:
	- To the [[Paschal Candle]], to be incensed.
	- To the [[High Ambo]] to incense.
	- **Immediately after the incensation**, [[Thurifer]] descends the [[High Ambo]], and then stands near the [[Choir Stalls]] on the South side (to maximize the distance between the smoke and the cantor.
- All other [[Altar Server|Servers]] remain in [[Choir Stalls#Low]] with [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] lit, facing the [[Ambo]].
- When the _Exsultet_ is complete:
	- [[Ignifer]] 3 turns on the minimal configuration of lights required for the [[Schola Cantorum]] to see their music, switches 25 and 26 on the panel. Then he returns to the [[Choir Stalls]] by way of the [[Passageway]].
	- [[Thurifer]] returns the [[Thurible]] to the [[Thurible Stand|Stand]] and returns to his seat.
 
### Liturgy of the Word
Extinguish [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] when the pamphlet says to / when the [[Celebrant]] does.

**Before the _Gloria_**:

- _Toward the end of the second-last lesson_, [[Ignifer]] 5 exits to the [[Sacristy]] by way of the [[Passageway]], making a [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] along the way.
- _Just after the last lesson, during the prayer_, [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] takes a [[Taper]] and waits near the [[Paschal Candle]]. As soon as the _Gloria_ starts to be intoned, he lights the taper and returns to the [[Choir Stalls|Choir Stall]].

##### Candles
