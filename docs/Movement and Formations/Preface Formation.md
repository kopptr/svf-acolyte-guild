Formation used in [[Dominican Rite Solemn High Mass]] during the Preface and much of the Eucharistic Prayer.

- [[Celebrant]] at [[High Altar]] in middle.
- [[Deacon]] and [[Subdeacon]] a step or two down and to his right/left, lined up with the red diamonds on the face of the [[High Altar]].
- [[Senior Acolyte]] at foot of [[High Altar|Altar]] in the same place as during [[Approach Formation]].
- [[Thurifer]], if present, on the large square behind the [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] and in the center.

It is identical to the [[Credo Formation]], except that the [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] are empty-handed, the [[Thurifer]] takes the position of the [[Crucifer]], and the [[Crucifer]] is absent.
