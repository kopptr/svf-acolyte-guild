## Steps
The Rosary altar has only two levels, the [[Predella]] and the foot. As a result, when one would otherwise be on the [[Top Step]], one should be on the [[Predella]], and when one would otherwise be on the [[Bottom Step]], one should be at the foot.

## Niche
Stone shelf off to the Epistle Side of the [[Altar]].
