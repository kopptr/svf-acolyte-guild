## Lip
On either of the steps to the Presbytery, there is a stone lip. This is where the [[Entrance Bells]] are kept, as well as prayer books for concelebrating priests. Depending on the liturgy, other items may be kept here, such as the [[Missal]] and stand.

## Niche
The stone shelf in the Presbytery on the Epistle Side. Usually used in lieu of a [[Credence Table]], though a [[Credence Table]] can be moved nearby if more space is needed.
