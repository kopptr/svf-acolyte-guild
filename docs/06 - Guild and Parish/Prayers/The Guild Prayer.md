To be prayed daily by those enrolled in the [[Guild of St. Stephen]].

>O God, you accept our ministry and allow us to serve at your altar; grant that while serving you we follow the example of our Patron, St. Stephen, the first martyr, and that we may, like him, come to see Jesus standing at your right hand in the kingdom of heaven. We ask this through Jesus Christ, your Son. Amen.
