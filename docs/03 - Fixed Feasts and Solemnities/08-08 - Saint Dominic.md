# 08-08 - Saint Dominic
We celebrate this as a solemnity since St. Dominic is the founder of the Order of Preachers. By ancient tradition, a Franciscan preaches to the Dominicans on St. Dominic's Day and a Dominican reciprocates on St. Francis's Day. For this reason, we celebrate in the Novus Ordo so that the guest Franciscan can concelebrate.
