## Email from Fr. Reginald
Sorry for the delay on this. Based on what we did Sunday, here are some changes for your notes:

- relic of true cross on monstrance stand
- servers and celebrant process in from lourdes door, sit in presbytery (where incense and cross stands are)
- celebrant will incense paschal candle when at font
- at beginning of antiphon of second psalm, servers lead...(you have "leave")
- the people don't enter the friars' chapel
- celebrant will incense true cross
- we didn't reverence the sanctuary on the way back from the friars' chapel, we just each bowed at the top of the presbytery steps
- servers stayed in presbytery (on bench)
- incense for high altar during magnificat
- there wasn't a book bearer, and the celebrant was able to hold the book for the collect; but we could have one of course
- for the solemn procession, the return functions kindof like aÂ zipper. i don't know how you want to explain that...
- after the solemn procession, we went back into the presbytery for the regina caeli and the versicle and prayer and blessing and dismissal. then we formed up at the foot of the presbytery, genuflected, and went into the sacristy through the friars' chapel
