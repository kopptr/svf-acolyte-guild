#### Entrance
[[Procession#Long Cloister Walk Procession to Crossing Altar]], see [[Procession#When there is a Bishop]].
- It is important for the [[Thurifer]] to time the Procession correctly so that all are in place in front of the [[Sanctuary]] when the _Introit_ begins, since everyone will reverence simultaneously.

As normal for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:

These servers [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] with the items and proceed to their seats[^incensation].
	- After the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Rubrics/Roles/Bishop|Bishop]] [[Celebrant]] sits (after the _Collect_), the [[Mitre Bearer]] assists the Assistant [[Deacon]] in assisting the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Rubrics/Roles/Bishop|Bishop]] in putting on his [[Mitre]][^first_sit].
