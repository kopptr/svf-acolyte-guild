## Overview
[[Roman Rite]] Solemn Mass celebrated at the [[Crossing Altar]]. These rubrics are used for the 12pm Sunday [[Mass]] at [[Saint Vincent Ferrer Church|SVF]], which is the "principal liturgy of the parish". Typically with one [[Deacon]], though sometimes there are zero or two[^deacon_thurifer] [[Deacon|Deacons]]. Typically with one [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Rubrics/Roles/Priest|Priest]] [[Celebrant]], though sometimes there are one or more [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]].

[^deacon_thurifer]: When there are two [[Deacon|Deacons]], it is apparently proper for the second [[Deacon]] to perform the [[Incensation]] during the Eucharistic Prayer instead of the [[Thurifer]]. We omit that rubric since we rarely have two [[Deacon|Deacons]], most [[Deacon|Deacons]] don't know it, and I don't know where the rubric is specified.

## Roles
Four servers:
- [[Thurifer]]
- [[Crucifer]], [[Book Bearer]], [[Bell Ringer]]
- [[Acolyte]] 1, [[Lucifer]] 1
- [[Acolyte]] 2, [[Lucifer]] 2

[^recession_destination]: See [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 193]], which says that we should recess to the [[Sacristy]] along the route we used in procession. We don't do this so the [[Celebrant]] and [[Deacon]] can greet the people. #liturgy-todo
