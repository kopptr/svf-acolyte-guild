[^candles]: There are four candles on the altar, but two is the proper number to be lit for a Low Mass. Since we don't want those four candles to burn unevenly, we alternate using the inner candles and outer candles each Mass. Refer to the Mass's event description in the [[Calendar]] to see which should be lit.
