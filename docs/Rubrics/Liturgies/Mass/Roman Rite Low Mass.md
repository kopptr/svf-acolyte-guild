aliases: ["Roman Rite Sung Mass"]
---
Celebrated at the [[Crossing Altar]] with one [[Altar Server|Server]]. Sung [[Mass]] [[Altar Server|Server]] rubrics are identical.

## Preparations
Typically all of the setup will be completed by the [[Celebrant]] before [[Mass]].
- [ ] [[Chalice Stack]] on [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] or [[Credence Table]], according to [[Celebrant]]'s preference. Place it center-right on the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] if the [[Missal]] and [[Missal Stand|Stand]] are there, otherwise in the center of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]].
- [ ] [[Missal]] and [[Missal Stand|Stand]] on [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] or [[Choir Stalls#Low]], according to [[Celebrant]]'s preference.
- [ ] [[Hand Bells]] in [[Choir Stalls#Low]]
- [ ] [[Cruets]], lavabo dish, and [[Finger Towel]] on [[Credence Table]]
- [ ] [[Crossing Altar#Candles]] lit.
- [ ] West pair of [[Sanctuary#Polychrome Candles]] lit.

## Order of Mass
Form up in [[Sacristy]], [[Pre-Mass Prayer with Ministers]].

### Procession
- Ring [[Hand Bells]] from [[Passageway]].
- If there is a prayer before [[Mass]] (e.g. the [[Angelus]]), wait until the final portion of the prayer (e.g. "Let us pray. Pour forth..."). Otherwise move immediately.
- Use [[Procession#Passageway Procession to Crossing Altar]] with one [[Altar Server|Server]] leading the [[Celebrant]] empty-handed.

### Introit through Collect
Hold [[Missal]] during the _Collect_. Some [[Celebrant]]s may prefer to have the [[Missal]] held for the opening prayers too.

### Lesson, Gradual, Epistle
Remain seated. Many Low/Sung Masses will only have one Reading.

### Acclamation
Stand when the [[Celebrant]] stands. Face South until the [[Minister]] to proclaim the _Gospel_ finishes reverencing the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]]. Then turn and face the [[Ambo]].

### Gospel
Stand facing the [[Ambo]].

### Homily
Sit.

### Creed, Universal Prayer
One or both of these may be omitted, especially for Low [[Mass]]. If they are performed, stand. Face South during the _Creed_, and the direction of whichever [[Minister]] is speaking during the _Universal Prayer_.

### Offertory
See [[Offertory]], especially [[Offertory#Sung and Low Mass]]. Depending on the [[Mass]], the cue could be the [[Celebrant]] approaching the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] or [[Credence Table]] from the [[Ambo]] after the _Homily_, or the start of an Offertory Chant. The [[Altar Server|Server]] must pay close attention.

### Preface, Sanctus
Turn to face the [[Crossing Altar]] when the _Preface_ starts. Kneel after the _Sanctus_.

### Eucharistic Prayer through Great Amen
Kneel. Ring the bells when appropriate, see [[Bell Ringer#Roman Rite]]. Stand after the _Great Amen_.

### Our Father, Rite of Peace, Agnus Dei
Stand facing West.

### Communion
- Ring the bell as the [[Celebrant]] receives from the [[Chalice]].
- Kneel just outside the [[Choir Stalls]] to receive Communion. Do not go right up to the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]], but also do not make the [[Celebrant]] walk far to get to you.

### Ablutions
See [[Ablutions]], especially [[Ablutions#Sung and Low Mass]].

### Postcommunion Prayer
Hold [[Missal]] for [[Celebrant]] when he is ready.

### Dismissal
**Cue**: The [[Celebrant]] approaches the [[Crossing Altar]] to reverence it:
- Stand behind him facing the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] on the black line.
- When he turns, turn and lead him to the foot of the [[Presbytery]], stand in the right-of-center tile.
- Wait for the [[Celebrant]] and [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] with him.
- Lead [[Celebrant]] to the [[Sacristy]] through the [[Passageway]]
