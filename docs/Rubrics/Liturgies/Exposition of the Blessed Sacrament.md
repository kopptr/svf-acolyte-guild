- Turn [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] microphone to face opposite direction.
- Move [[Monstrance Stand]] to the [[Crossing Altar]]. Place on the West side of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]], so as not to disturb the vessels, and do so from the West side of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]].

- Light [[Thurible]] coals if not already lit.
- Place Holy Hour booklets at the foot of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] in the middle, if not already there.

#### Ablutions
- [[Celebrant]] or other clergy will retrieve the [[Lunette]], [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] as he passes you with it.

### If Exposition is standalone
- Start from [[Cloister Walk]], ring entrance bell.

- Kneel at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]], waiting while [[Christianity/Biblical Events, Figures, and Themes/Priest]] retrieves the Eucharist and exposes it.
