- [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Ritual]] for the [[Celebrant]] at the [[Sedilia]] immediately after the first incensation for the opening prayers.
- The _Penitential Act_ is omitted.
- The _Gloria_ is sung.
- Gospel Procession:
	- [[Celebrant]] [[Imposition of Incense|Imposes Incense]] at the [[Sedilia]]. Gospel procession uses the usual route, but must go around the couple. [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] split the couple, [[Thurifer]] goes to their right.

### Rite of Marriage

- [[Holy Water Bearer]] and [[Wedding Crucifix Bearer]] ready the [[Wedding Crucifix]] and [[Aspersorium]].

#### Questions & Consent
If no [[Wedding Crucifix]] is used, this is omitted.

**Cue**: _Since it is your intention_:
- [[Wedding Crucifix Bearer]] brings the [[Wedding Crucifix]] to the couple, hands it to them, and returns to [[Passageway]]. No reverence.

- [[Wedding Crucifix Bearer]] receives the [[Wedding Crucifix]], and returns to [[Passageway]] immediately making no reverence. [[Holy Water Bearer]] stands by.
- The [[Celebrant]] blesses the rings and sprinkles them. When he returns the [[Aspergillium]], [[Holy Water Bearer]] returns to [[Passageway]] immediately, making no reverence.
