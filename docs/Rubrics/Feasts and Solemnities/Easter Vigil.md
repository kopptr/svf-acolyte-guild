## Order of Mass

### Lucernarium
A.k.a. Service of Light.

#### Entrance
This is not a procession or solemn entrance. The Lucernarium starts when everyone is in place and the priest starts the prayers.

Go to the 66th St. Entrance outside near the ramp. Move so as to be hidden: leave the [[Sacristy]] through the [[Baptistery]] into the [[Narthex]], then out the 66th St. door in the [[Narthex]], and East on 66th St. to the entrance near the [[Rosary Altar]]:
- [[Thurifer]] has **unlit** [[Thurible]].
- [[Boat Bearer]] has boat and tongs.
- [[Lucifer]] 1 has shortest [[Taper]].
- [[Book Bearer]] 1 bears [[Missal]] and carries it in procession.
- A priest, not the Celebrant, carries the [[Paschal Candle]].
- Everyone else holds [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]]. Someone should have extra [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] for Celebrant, Deacon, and [[Boat Bearer]].

Form up:
- [[Book Bearer]] 1 near priest.
- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] with an easy path to the fire.
- Everyone else in two lines out of the way.

#### Blessing of Fire and Preparation of the Candle
- [[Book Bearer]] 1 holds [[Missal]] for the lighting and blessing of the fire.
- After the fire is lit and blessed, [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] light [[Thurible]]:
	- This action is done **discreetly**, as the preparation of the [[Paschal Candle]] will have begun.
	- Both approach the fire. [[Thurifer]] holds [[Thurible]] open.
	- [[Boat Bearer]] uses tongs to take charcoal brickettes from [[Thurible]], light them in the fire, and place them back in the [[Thurible]].
	- When finished, [[Thurifer]] closes [[Thurible]] and both return to their place.
	- [[Boat Bearer]] pockets the tongs, or holds them in his off hand.
- [[Book Bearer]] 1 continues to hold [[Missal]] for the preparation of the [[Paschal Candle]].
- When finished, [[Lucifer]] 1 lights the [[Taper]] from the fire and hands it to the Celebrant. Celebrant lights the [[Paschal Candle]] and hands the [[Taper]] back, which [[Lucifer]] 1 extinguishes.

#### Procession
- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] go to Celebrant to charge incense. **[[Boat Bearer]] gives boat to [[Thurifer]] when done**, and then takes a [[Hand Candle]].
- [[Thurifer]] leads the procession alone, followed by the [[Paschal Candle]], followed by the other severs, then everyone else. Three legs, each stopping for "Christ our light"/"Thanks be to God":
	1. Just inside ( #todo just outside?) the 66th St. Door:
		- Servers other than the [[Thurifer]] form up behind in pairs.
		- [[Book Bearer]] 1 carries the [[Missal]] in the procession and should be in the last pair.
	2. Into the church through the 66th St. Entrance. West down the side aisle, South toward the rear entrance, stop at the back of the church, facing the [[Sanctuary]].
		- [[Lucifer]] 1 lights [[Taper]] from [[Paschal Candle]], and all servers' [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] are lit.
		- Five servers, everyone except [[Thurifer]] and [[Book Bearer]] 1, use [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]]/[[Taper|Tapers]] and spread out, one on every edge of the main sets of pews, except the edge closest to the Confessionals. They start lighting peoples' candles from the back moving forward. Only light every other or every third person's [[Hand Candle]] so as to keep pace with the moving [[Paschal Candle]].
		- [[Book Bearer]] 1 processes behind the [[Paschal Candle]] while other servers do the lighting.
	4. To the foot of the [[Sanctuary]]. [[Thurifer]] stands off to the North side during intonation.
		- [[Thurifer]] leads [[Paschal Candle]] to its stand in front of the ambo.
		- Other servers enter the [[Sanctuary]] and go to their seats in [[Choir Stalls#Low]]. #todo go directly there, or form up at foot of altar, bow, and go up left side?
			- [[Boat Bearer]] returns tongs to [[Thurible Stand]].
			- [[Book Bearer]] 1 returns [[Missal]] to stand in [[Choir Stalls#Low]].
			- [[Lucifer]] 1 returns [[Taper]].
			- All stand in [[Choir Stalls#Low]] with lit [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]], facing the [[Ambo]] where the [[#Exsultet]] is to be sung.
		- When [[Paschal Candle]] is in place, [[Thurifer]] returns to [[Choir Stalls]] by most direct route ( #todo should he go to foot of altar and bow instead?)

#### Exsultet
- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] go to Celebrant at his chair so he can impose incense.
	- [[Boat Bearer]] holds Celebrant's [[Hand Candle]] during imposition of incense and bears [[Incense Boat]] as usual.
- When finished, [[Boat Bearer]] returns [[Hand Candle]] to Celebrant and returns to his seat.
- [[Thurifer]] then leads whomever will proclaim the [[#Exsultet]]:
	- To the [[Paschal Candle]], to be incensed.
	- To the [[Ambo]], likely high one, to incense.
	- Blue book says he leaves right away, rather than stays there to let it be more smokier. #todo how smoky do we want it?
- All other servers remain in [[Choir Stalls#Low]] with hand candles lit, facing the [[Ambo]].
 
### Liturgy of the Word
Extinguish hand candles when the pamphlet/Celebrant says to.

#### Greeting
#todo is there a greeting? Do we wait for the proclaimer of the [[#Exsultet]] to return to his place?

#### Lessons
[[Book Bearer]] 1 bears [[Missal]] for the introduction of the readings, and then again for the prayers following each psalm after each reading.

#### Gloria
During the _Gloria_, one team of servers lights candles, another rings bells.

##### Bells
- Bells rung by [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]].
- #todo Consult James for precisely when to ring, likely the same as at [[Holy Thursday#Gloria]].

##### Candles
Other five servers light candles and turn on [[Church Lights]]. **There are a lot of candles. This should be done quickly, though still in a dignified manner**. The goal is to finish lighting everything and be back to our seats before the sung _Gloria_ ends.
- **Before the _Gloria_, during the prayer after the last lesson**:
	- [[Lucifer]]s 1 and 4 take [[Taper]]s, light them from the [[Paschal Candle]], and form up at the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]].
	- [[Lucifer]] 5 grabs a [[Taper]], approaches the [[Presbytery]], [[Inclination#Major Inclination]] to the [[High Altar]], then enters the [[Sacristy]] and heads for the circuit breakers.
- When _Gloria_ is intoned:
	- [[Lucifer]] 5 turns on all the [[Church Lights]]. When finished, grab a [[Taper]] and help the others.
		- "Solemn Mass" setting.
		- #todo is there another breaker to flip?
	- [[Lucifer]]s 2 and 3 leave the [[Choir Stalls]], get [[Taper]]s, and standby.
	- [[Lucifer]]s 1 and 4 [[Inclination#Major Inclination]] to the [[Crossing Altar]], then enter the [[Sanctuary]] to its left.
	- [[Lucifer]]s 1 and 4 light the other [[Lucifer]]s [[Taper]]s.
	- [[Lucifer]]s 1-5 light these candles ( #todo final list from FPM, decide who does what):
		- [[High Altar#Candles]].
		- [[High Altar#Angel Candles]].
		- Four [[Sanctuary#Polychrome Candles]].
		- [[Crossing Altar#Candles]]. 
		- [[Processional Candle]]s.
		- [[Rosary Altar]] candles ( #todo confirm)
		- [[Friars' Chapel#Rood]] candles.
		- [[Friars' Chapel]] candles ( #todo confirm)
		- Other side altar candles ( #todo confirm)
		- **DO NOT light the [[Sanctuary#Lamps]]**.
- All return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]] when finished and extinguish [[Taper]]s.
- If you hear _Jesu Christe_, just quit and return to your choir stall.

	- #todo [[Lucifer]]s 2 and 4 should help. Should they come down with [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] at this point? Instead, should they have processed with hand candles so they're nearby?
