[[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]] during [[Lent]] with [[Litany of the Saints]]. No Rite of Sending of Catechumens.

## Preparation
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:
- Processional candles start lit, and in their place near the [[Choir Stalls#Low]].
- [[Thurible Stand]] as normal, but thurible and boat are there at the start of Mass.

## Order of Mass
As usual during [[Lent]], except:
- Use [[Procession#Passageway Procession to Crossing Altar]].
- Penitential Rite omitted.
- Addition [[#Special Collect]]
- [[Litany of the Saints]] Procession
- Credo omitted

## Special Collect
An additional Collect is prayed at this Mass. Since Penitential Rite and Gloria are omitted, this happens immediately after the [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Processional Incensation of the Altar|First Incensation]].

When the priest is returning to the [[Chair]], the [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Missal]] for him as with the normal [[Collect]]. When finished, he returns to his seat and returns the [[Missal]], as with the normal Collect.

### [[Litany of the Saints]] Procession
Immediately following the special collect, the procession starts. Acolytes retrieve the candle, [[Thurifer]] self-charges the thurible and holds it, and [[Crucifer]] retrieves the crucifix.

Then everyone forms up as [[Procession#Four Servers with Incense]] and the [[Thurifer]] leads the procession. The order is Servers, Schola, Ministers. The route is [[Procession#Penitential Procession from the Crossing Altar]].

The [[Litany of the Saints]] is very long, and so the pace should be very slow.

A brief sung Kyrie will follow the procession.

### Collect
The usual [[Collect]] follows immediately after the Kyrie that ends the procession.
