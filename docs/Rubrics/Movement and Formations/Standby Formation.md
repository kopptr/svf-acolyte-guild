## Usage
Used in [[Roman Rite]] [[Mass|Masses]], when one or more [[Altar Server|Servers]] have duties to attend to at the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]] or [[Credence Table]], and are waiting for the appropriate time to take those actions.

## Form
All of the [[Altar Server|Servers]] who are not performing a liturgical action stand in a line perpendicular to the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]] and facing it.
- [[Altar Server|Servers]] who _do not_ need to take a liturgical action sit in the [[Choir Stalls]] to free up space. For example, the [[Thurifer]] during the [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Ablutions]][^should_they_stand].
- [[Altar Server|Servers]] who _do_ need to take a liturgical action, stand in the line to promote ease of movement.
	- If the server will act next, he should be in the line closest to the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]]. For example, the [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] waiting to bring the [[Cruets]] while the [[Chalice Stack]] is being disassembled.
	- If the [[Altar Server|Server]] will not act next, he should be in the line, but in a position not closest to the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]].
	- If needed, [[Altar Server|Servers]] should temporarily step back or to the side to let other [[Altar Server|Servers]] in and out of the formation. For example, after the [[Book Bearer]] places the [[Missal]] and stand on the [[Crossing Altar]] during the [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Offertory]], his liturgical actions are done, and the [[Altar Server|Server]] closest to the [[Choir Stalls#Low]], likely the [[Thurifer]], should step back to allow the [[Book Bearer]] into the [[Choir Stalls]].
	- [[Altar Server|Servers]] should hold whatever items they need for their next liturgical action while in this formation, so as not to cause delay. For example, during the [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Offertory]] the [[Thurifer]] should stand in formation with the [[Thurible]] and [[Incense Boat]] while other servers are presenting the [[Cruets]].
	- [[Altar Server|Servers]] should make space for others to return to formation after their action according to the guidelines above. For example, during the [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Ablutions]], when one [[Acolyte]] is returning to formation from retrieving a [[Personal Chalice]], the other [[Acolyte]], who is still in formation and will retrieve the next item from the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]], should step right so as to make room for the returning [[Altar Server|Server]], while still preserving himself in the position of the next actor.

[^should_they_stand]: Should they stand in the formation? At the [[High Altar]] this is probably silly, but at the [[Crossing Altar]] it can look sloppy if some [[Altar Server|Servers]] are sitting while others are not. #liturgy-todo 

## Considerations for the Crossing Altar
For [[Mass|Masses]] at the [[Crossing Altar]], the formation looks best if the line of [[Altar Server|Servers]] extends out of the [[Choir Stalls]]. This way, [[Altar Server|Servers]] who are standing or sitting in the [[Choir Stalls]] are in line with the formation, and all look to be one unit.

## Considerations for the High Altar
For [[Mass|Masses]] at the [[High Altar]]:
- There is more space in the [[Presbytery]], so the [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] can stand in front of the [[Presbytery#Niche]] so as to have easy access to it, and the [[Thurifer]] can stand to their left when not acting next, and to their right when acting next. All three stand in an orderly line facing North.
- The [[Book Bearer]] waits for cues and approaches the [[High Altar]] from the Gospel side. He should wait in a position that mirrors the [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] and [[Thurifer]] on the Gospel side, facing South. He must be mindful to [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] to the [[High Altar]] when crossing the middle of it.
- When assisting at the [[High Altar]], all [[Altar Server|Servers]] approach from the steps on the sides of the [[High Altar|Altar]], never from the steps in front of it.
