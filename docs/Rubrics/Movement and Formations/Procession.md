Generally:
- Left turns are for penitential seasons and occasions, right turns are for festive seasons and occasions.
- Longer processions are for more solemn occasions.

## Formation
Processions that do not include the Eucharist (see [[Eucharistic Procession]] for those) are arranged as shown below[^diagram].
```
  T
 B

L C L

 S S
 ...
 S S
  S
```
Where:
- `T` is the [[Thurifer]] with the [[Thurible]].
	- If incense is not used in the procession, [[Thurifer]] as treated as an additional [[Altar Server|Server]] (`S`).
- `B` is the [[Boat Bearer]] with the [[Incense Boat]].
	- If incense is not used in the procession, [[Boat Bearer]] as treated as an additional [[Altar Server|Server]] (`S`).
- `L` are [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]].
- `C` is the [[Crucifer]] with the [[Processional Crucifix]].
- `S` are additional [[Altar Server|Servers]], if any. They are empty-handed.
	- `S` are in pairs, if there is an odd [[Altar Server|Server]], he is at the end in the middle.

### Adjustments for fewer Servers

#### Four servers
Omit the [[Boat Bearer]]. This is the most common case.

#### Three servers
Use only [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] and [[Crucifer]], omitting the [[Boat Bearer]] and [[Thurifer]].

#### Two servers
Use only [[Thurifer]] and [[Crucifer]], omitting the [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] and [[Boat Bearer]].

#### One server
Use only [[Crucifer]]. For less solemn occasions, use only a single empty-handed [[Altar Server|Server]] instead of a [[Crucifer]].

### When there is a Bishop
The formation is[^bishop]:

```
    Th
Bo

Cb  Cr  Cb
  Se  Se
    ..
  Se  Se
    MC
  Ch  Ch
    ..
  Ch  Ch
    De
  Cc  Cc
    ..
  Cc  Cc
  MC
    Bi
  De  De
Cz  Bb  Mb
```
Where:
- `Th` is the [[Thurifer]]
- `Bo` is the [[Boat Bearer]]
- `Cb` are [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]]
- `Cr` is the [[Crucifer]]
- `Se` are other [[Altar Server|Servers]]
- `MC` are the [[Master of Ceremonies|Masters of Ceremonies]]. If there is only one, he takes the spot closer to the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Rubrics/Roles/Bishop|Bishop]].
- `Ch` are those in Choir Dress, Canons follow Clergy.
- `De` are [[Deacon|Deacons]]. If there is only one, he takes the position closer to the [[Crucifer]].
- `Cc` are [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]].
- `Bi` is the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Rubrics/Roles/Bishop|Bishop]].
- `Cz` is the [[Crozier Bearer]].
- `Bb` is the [[Book Bearer]].
- `Mb` is the [[Mitre Bearer]].

## Routes

### Passageway Procession to Crossing Altar
When using this route, no incense, [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]], or [[Processional Crucifix]] are used in the procession.

[[Altar Server|Servers]] enter the [[Sanctuary]] through the [[Passageway]] in pairs. Each pair stops at the foot of the [[Presbytery]] to [[Genuflection|Genuflect]]. The next pair does not enter the [[Sanctuary]] until the previous pair stand from their [[Genuflect|Genuflection]].

After standing, the pair of [[Altar Server|Servers]] turns inwards and processes down the center of the [[Sanctuary]] toward the [[Crossing Altar]]. At about the black line, they move right and  go to their seats at [[Choir Stalls#Low]].

If there are an odd number of [[Altar Server|Servers]], the last [[Altar Server|Server]] leads the [[Celebrant]] if there are no other [[Minister|Ministers]], or processes alone if there are.

If leading the [[Celebrant]], [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] with him at the [[Tabernacle]].
