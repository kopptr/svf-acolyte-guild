Bow the head at the neck, shoulders and waist/back. You've gone low enough if you can touch your knees with your hands (but doing so is not part of the inclination). This inclination is #dominican [[Preservation of Dominican Customs|Custom]].

Uses:
- To reverence an altar on approaching it when both 1) one has just entered or is about to leave the altar's area and 2) the altar does not have a [[Tabernacle]] with the Eucharist reposed.
- Similarly for the [[Sanctuary]] when no Eucharist is reposed in the [[Tabernacle]], such as on [[Good Friday]].
