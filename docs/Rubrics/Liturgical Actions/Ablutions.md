The _Ablutions_ are the part of [[Mass]] wherein the sacred vessels are purified, any leftover Eucharist is reposed in the [[Tabernacle]], and the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]] is cleared.

## Roman Rite
In the [[Roman Rite]], the Ablutions occur immediately after Communion.

### If there is no Deacon
[[Acolyte|Acolytes]] and [[Book Bearer]] stand, get into [[Standby Formation]] and work out of it for the duration of the Ablutions[^ablutions]. **Cue**: The [[Celebrant]] returns to the [[Sanctuary]] after distributing Communion.
- An [[Acolyte]] brings the water [[Cruet]] to the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]]. Depending on the [[Celebrant]]'s preference:
	- [[Acolyte]] pours water over the [[Celebrant]]'s fingers and into the [[Chalice]] until the [[Celebrant]] indicates he should stop, by saying so or raising the [[Chalice]].
	- [[Acolyte]] gives the [[Celebrant]] the water [[Cruet]] and stays near the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]] until the [[Celebrant]] returns it.
	- [[Acolyte]] pours water into vessels as indicated by the [[Celebrant]].
	- More than one of the above.
	- When finished, the [[Acolyte]] returns the water [[Cruet]] to the [[Credence Table]].
- If there are items on the [[Credence Table]] that need to be returned to the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]], such as a [[Chalice Veil]], an [[Acolyte]] places them on the Northeast corner of the [[High Altar|Altar]].
- The [[Celebrant]] indicates that items are purified by placing them on the Northeast corner of the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]]. These include [[Ciborium|Ciboria]], [[Pyxe|Pyxes]], and [[Personal Chalice|Personal Chalices]]. The [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] take turns taking purified items from the Northeast corner of the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]] and returning them to the [[Credence Table]].
	- If the [[Celebrant]] places a folded [[Corporal]] on the corner of the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]], the [[Acolyte]] brings an empty [[Burse]] from the [[Credence Table]] to the [[High Altar|Altar]], places the [[Corporal]] in the [[Burse]], and returns both to the [[Credence Table]]. The [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] should anticipate this by noting if the [[Celebrant]] is folding an extra [[Corporal]].
- The [[Book Bearer]] retrieves the [[Missal]] and [[Missal Stand|Stand]] and returns them to their place.
	- **Cue**: The [[Celebrant]] drinks the Ablutions from the [[Chalice]].
- The last item the [[Acolyte]] should take is the [[Chalice Stack]]. When everything is taken from the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]], all [[Altar Server|Servers]] return to their seats. The [[Book Bearer]] should take the most convenient position for the Postcommunion Prayer.

[^ablutions]: See: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 163, 192]]. The latter says that only an instituted [[Acolyte]] may assist with the Ablutions. It seems that this is in the context of actually purifying the vessels. Since we only assist with the water cruet, and the [[Celebrant]] or [[Deacon]] purifies the vessels, this is okay.

### If there is a Deacon
If there is a [[Deacon]], he will perform some or all of the duties of the [[Celebrant]] for the Ablutions. This is the [[Celebrant]]'s preference; the [[Celebrant]] may sit down to let the [[Deacon]] perform the Ablutions, or move to the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]] to do them himself.

If a [[Deacon]] is present and performing the Ablutions himself, the [[Altar Server|Servers]] do as usual, attending to the [[Deacon]] instead of the [[Celebrant]].

Whether the [[Deacon]] or the [[Celebrant]] performs the Ablutions, **allow the [[Deacon]] to return the [[Chalice Stack]] to the [[Credence Table]]**, as it is properly his role to do so. If the [[Deacon]] leaves the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]] without taking the [[Chalice Stack]], only then should an [[Acolyte]] retrieve it.

### Be mindful of the Eucharist
If there are leftover Eucharist hosts, the [[Celebrant]], [[Deacon]], or another [[Minister]] will either consume them, or consolidate them into a [[Ciborium]] and repose them in the [[Tabernacle]]. All [[Altar Server|Servers]] should be mindful of this.

If the Eucharist will be reposed, [[Altar Server|Servers]] should [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] when the [[Minister]] carrying the Eucharist passes them. If the [[Altar Server|Server]] is at the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]] when the [[Minister]] takes the Eucharist from it, he should [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] in sync with any [[Minister|Ministers]] at the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]].

If [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]] follows [[Mass]], a [[Minister]] will bring the [[Luna]] from the [[Tabernacle]] to the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]]. Similarly, the [[Altar Server|Servers]] should be aware of this and [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] as the Eucharist passes them.

### Sung and Low Mass
For [[Roman Rite Low Mass|Roman Rite Sung Mass]] and [[Roman Rite Low Mass]], the rubrics are identical, except:
- One [[Altar Server|Server]] must take on the role of both [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] and the [[Book Bearer]].
- Be mindful of the [[Celebrant]]'s preferences:
	- If the [[Celebrant]] prefers to pray the Postcommunion Prayer and Dismissal at the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]], do not remove the [[Missal]].
	- If the [[Celebrant]] prefers, do not remove the [[Chalice Stack]] from the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]].
