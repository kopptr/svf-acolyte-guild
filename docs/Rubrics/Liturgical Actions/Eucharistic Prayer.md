In the [[Roman Rite]], the [[Altar Server|Server]] duties during the Eucharistic Prayer depend on how many [[Altar Server|Servers]] there are and the solemnity of the [[Mass]].

## Formation
On a maximally solemn occasion, the [[Altar Server|Servers]] line up at the foot of the appropriate [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]] as shown below.

```
         AA
L3 L1 __ Th Bb L2 L4
```
In the diagram:
- `AA` is the center of the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Liturgical Items/Altar|Altar]].
- `L1-4` are [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] bearing [[Torch|Torches]].
- `Th` is the [[Thurifer]].
- `Bb` is the [[Boat Bearer]].
- `__` is empty space, creating symmetry.
- Not pictured, the [[Bell Ringer]] at his seat.

On less solemn occasions, or if we have fewer [[Altar Server|Servers]] available, we remove roles.

For a typical for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]] and [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]], we use `Th`, `L1`, `L2`, and the [[Bell Ringer]].

For a typical for [[Roman Rite Low Mass]] or [[Roman Rite Low Mass|Roman Rite Sung Mass]], we only have the [[Bell Ringer]], and none of the [[Altar Server|Servers]] line up in this formation.
