Parishioners will begin to recognize you as an [[Altar Server]], so always conduct yourself so as to be a good example of Christian virtue, humility, and reverence. This is true both when serving and not. The following guidelines apply when serving liturgies, and will serve to aid the [[Altar Server|Server]] in accomplishing this goal while also helping liturgies to run smoothly and reverently.

## Before a Liturgy

### Arrive
- **Timing**: Arrive early enough to spend a little time in prayer, vest, ready the altar, and have 5-10 minutes of silence in the [[Sacristy]].
	- If the liturgy is especially complicated or it is a special occasion, arrive earlier.
- **Prayer**: Time spent in prayer can either be in the pews where the congregation sits, or in the [[Friars' Chapel]].
- **Entrance**: Enter the [[Sacristy]] discreetly if possible. Ideally enter through the [[Baptistery]] or [[Lourde's Door]]. Otherwise enter through the [[Friars' Chapel]]. We don't want people in the congregation to think they are allowed in the [[Sanctuary]], [[Friars' Chapel]], or [[Sacristy]], and so we don't want to be seen entering that way.
- **Silence**: Try to keep silence in the [[Sacristy]][^silence], especially before a liturgy. Hold conversations in the [[Back Sacristy]] only. Be sensitive to the state of the [[SVF Acolyte Guild/Rubrics/Roles/Priest|Priest]]. If it's thirty minutes before the liturgy and he's politely greeting you, go ahead and converse. If it's five minutes before the liturgy starts and he's vesting, keep silence.

[^silence]: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 45]]

### Vest and Prepare the Sanctuary
- **Modesty**: When changing in the [[Back Sacristy]], make sure you are not in the doorway so no one walking by in the [[Sacristy]] can see you. Alternatively, close the door.
- **Wash Hands**: With soap and water, saying [[Vesting Prayers#Hand Washing]].
- **Cassock**: Don [[Cassock]] while praying [[Vesting Prayers#Cassock]]. Don't put on the [[Surplice]] yet; we set everything else up before finishing vesting so as not to get wax/coal/etc. on the [[Surplice]]. This can be relaxed if there is a time crunch.
- **Prepare**: The [[Sanctuary]]. See the _Preparation_ section for the particular liturgy you are serving.
- **Surplice**: Don the [[Surplice]] while praying [[Vesting Prayers#Surplice]]

### Prepare for Liturgy
- **Pre-Mass Prayer**: If the liturgy is a [[Mass]], pray [[Guild Prayer Before Serving]], ideally with all the [[Altar Server|Servers]] present, but don't delay the [[Mass]] in order to wait for a [[Altar Server|Server]].
- **Wait in [[Sacristy]]**: In the 5-10 minutes before the liturgy, wait in the [[Sacristy]], keeping silence. We do this to:
	- Enter a state of prayerful recollection.
	- To ask the [[Celebrant]] questions about this particular liturgy (e.g. "Will you proclaim the [[Gospel]] from the [[Ambo]] or the [[High Ambo]]?).
	- As buffer time, especially for complicated liturgies, to double check that everything is ready.
- **Ready**: If appropriate for the liturgy, the [[Crucifer]] and [[Thurifer]] should retrieve the [[Processional Crucifix]] and [[Thurible]] with about 5 minutes left.
	- If there is lit charcoal, the [[Thurifer]] should wait just outside the [[Sacristy]] near the light panel, so as not to risk setting off the smoke alarm.
- **Pray**: When the [[Celebrant]] is ready, line up facing the [[Sacristy]] crucifix. This usually involves [[Pre-Mass Prayer with Ministers]], but pray as the [[Celebrant]] does.
- **Get into place**: File to wherever the liturgy will begin, and line up in the appropriate order.
- **Start Liturgy**: When the [[Celebrant]] is ready a [[Altar Server|Server]] rings a nearby bell once to indicate the liturgy is started.

## After a Liturgy
- **Pray with [[Celebrant]]**: This usually involves [[Post-Mass Prayer with Ministers]], but pray as the [[Celebrant]] does.
- **Return to Sacristy**: Depending on the liturgy, you might take a different route or already be there. If used, [[Thurible]], [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]], and [[Processional Crucifix]] should be deposited in their places along the way.
- **Pray with Servers**: In the [[Back Sacristy]], pray [[Guild Prayer After Serving]] with all the servers.
- **Surplice**: In the [[Back Sacristy]], take off the [[Surplice]] and put it away on the correct hanger. We do this so as not to get it dirty.
- **Sanctuary**: Clean up the [[Sanctuary]], as is appropriate for the liturgy.
- **Cassock**: In the [[Back Sacristy]], take off the [[Cassock]] and put it away on the correct hanger. Finish changing if needed, again out of sight of passersby.
- **Pray**: Ideally, spend a couple minutes in prayer in the church.
