The _Bell Ringer_ rings the [[Hand Bells]].

## Roman Rite
Eight bell rings:
- Once at [[Epiclesis]][^epiclesis].
- Thrice at elevation of the Most Precious Body. Wait until about the apex of the elevation to start. Short rings, with pauses in between. If there is a [[Thurifer]], try to time with his [[Incensation]].
- Thrice at elevation of the Most Precious Blood. Same technique as for Most Precious Body.
- Once when the [[Celebrant]] receives from the [[Chalice]][^last].
	- If a [[Lector]] is reading the Communion Antiphon and happens to start speaking before the last bell ring, wait until the [[Lector]] finishes the Antiphon before ringing the bell.

[^epiclesis]: See: [[GIRM#p150]], which says "A little before the Consecration". We ring it at the Epiclesis because that is the Roman and Dominican tradition, and nowhere else makes sense.
[^elevations]: See: [[GIRM#p150]], which doesn't specify three times, but instead says "according to local custom". We ring three times at the elevations, a reference the three rings at the Consecration in the Tridentine Roman and Dominican Rites.
[^last]: This is not specified in the [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM]], but is a local custom.
