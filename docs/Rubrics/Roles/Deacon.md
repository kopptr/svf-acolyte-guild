aliases: ["Deacons"]

An ordained Deacon. Our parish maintains the custom of splitting the Deacon's duties when two are present: One is the Deacon of the Word, and one is the Deacon of the Altar.

## Dominican Rite
In the [[Dominican Rite]], the [[Deacon]] is the ordained Minister assisting the [[Celebrant]], even if that Minister happens to be an ordained [[Priest]].
