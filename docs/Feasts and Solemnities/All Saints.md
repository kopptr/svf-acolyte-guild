- When the [[Celebrant]] descends the [[High Altar]], [[Altar Server|Servers]] turn West and lead the [[Procession]] using the usual [[Procession#Formation]].

	- West down the main aisle, turn right.
	- North toward the [[St. Patrick Chapel]], turn right.
	- East toward the [[Rosary Altar]], turn right.
	- South toward the [[Lourde's Door]], in front of the main pews. Do **not** stop to reverence when crossing the [[Sanctuary]]. Turn right.

- [[Celebrant]] stands at the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]], where he would normally stand during [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]].

### Exposition
See [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Modifications for Exposition not following Mass]].

- All [[Reverence]] with the [[Celebrant]].
- [[Celebrant]] enters the [[Sanctuary]] to retrieve the Eucharist. Meanwhile:
	- [[Thurifer]]: Stands by in place.
	- [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]]: Move to the North side of the North-facing pews, and face North (i.e. the [[Crossing Altar]]).
- Then, as usual for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament]] starting from [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Incensation]], with extra people standing by. [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] do not kneel.

### Exit
When finished, the [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] recess through the [[Lourde's Door]], joined by the [[Thurifer]] (empty-handed), [[Schola Cantorum]], and [[Celebrant]].

## Benediction
[[Benediction]] follows Holy Hour at 8pm. Only one [[Altar Server|Server]] is needed and it is done as normal.

## Cleanup
Snuff all candles immediately after [[Benediction]], as they need time to cool and harden before being switched for unbleached candles.
