### Entrance through Agnus Dei
As normal for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]].

### Communion
As normal for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]]. Then during the [[Peoples' Communion]], set the [[Crossing Altar]] for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]] (see [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Peoples' Communion]]):

- [[Thurifer]]:
	- Move [[Thurible Stand]] and accessories to spot for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]].
	- Add charcoal to [[Thurible]].
	- Standby in [[Passageway]] with [[Thurible]] and [[Incense Boat]] until the [[#Litany of Saints Procession]].
- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]]:
	- Unfold and place a [[Corporal]] in the center of the [[Crossing Altar]].
	- Light and place the [[Candelabra|Candelabrae]].

	- Place the [[Monstrance]] on the South side of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]].
	- Place a Holy Hour booklet on the second step at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].

When finished, [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] and [[Book Bearer]] return to [[Choir Stalls#High]] and kneel until the [[#Ablutions]].

### Ablutions
As normal for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]]. Then:

- The [[Celebrant]] will expose the Eucharist at the [[Crossing Altar]]. Kneel as He passes if in the [[Choir Stalls]], or [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] if standing elsewhere.
- When the [[Celebrant]] returns to his chair, the [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] meet him and assist him in changing into his [[Cope]], then return to the [[Passageway]] and ready the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] and [[Processional Crucifix]].
 
### Postcommunion Prayer
- The [[Book Bearer]] bears the book as normal.
- [[Thurifer]] imposes incense.

### Litany of Saints Procession
**Cue**: [[Celebrant]] intones _Let us proceed in peace_. Procession begins.

- [[Book Bearer]] returns [[Prayers at the Chair]] book and heads immediately to [[Passageway]] and receives [[Processional Crucifix]] from an [[Acolyte]].
- The [[Altar Server|Servers]] lead the [[Procession]] using the usual [[Procession#Formation]], processing directly from the [[Passageway]], reverencing _neither_ the [[Tabernacle]] _nor_ the exposed Eucharist along the way.
- Route:
	- West through the middle of the [[Sanctuary]], passing the [[Celebrant]]
		- The [[Schola Cantorum]] and [[Celebrant]] join.
	- Around the right/North side of the [[Crossing Altar]] and West out of the [[Sanctuary]].
	- West down the main aisle, turn right.
	- North toward the [[St. Patrick Chapel]], turn right.
	- East toward the [[Rosary Altar]], turn right.
	- South toward the [[Lourde's Door]], in front of the main pews. Do not stop to reverence when crossing the [[Sanctuary]]. Turn right.
	- West in the aisle between the main aisle and the confessionals toward the [[Holy Name Chapel]]. Turn right.
	- North toward the main aisle, turn right.
	- East up the main aisle.

As the procession approaches the [[Sanctuary]], break formation:

- [[Thurifer]] stands square with the South side of the [[Crossing Altar]], where he would normally stand during [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]].
- [[Crucifer]], flanked by [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]], stand in front of the North-facing pews, facing the Eucharist.
- [[Schola Cantorum]] files along the pews facing the [[Rosary Altar]], facing the Eucharist to the South.
- [[Celebrant]] stands at the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]], where he would normally stand during [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]].

### Exposition
As usual for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament]] starting from [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Incensation]], with extra people standing by. [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] do not kneel.

### Exit
When finished, the [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] recess through the [[Lourde's Door]], joined by the [[Thurifer]] (empty-handed), [[Schola Cantorum]], and [[Celebrant]].

## Benediction
[[Benediction]] follows Holy Hour at 8pm. Only one [[Altar Server|Server]] is needed and it is done as normal.

## Cleanup
Snuff all candles immediately after [[Benediction]], as they need time to cool and harden before being switched for unbleached candles.
