## Overview
[[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]], with the [[#Litany of Saints Procession]]. In 2023, the solemnity falls on a Wednesday, and so Mass is followed by [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]], Holy Hour, and [[Benediction]]. Normally, Mass would conclude with a [[Solemn Blessing]].

- [ ] [[High Altar#Angel Candles]] lit.

As normal for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]], except:

- The [[Crossing Altar]] is prepared for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]] during the [[Peoples' Communion]].

- All exit to the [[Sacristy]] through the [[Lourde's Door]].

### Entrance through Agnus Dei
As normal for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]].

### Communion
As normal for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]]. Then during the [[Peoples' Communion]], set the [[Crossing Altar]] for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]] (see [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Peoples' Communion]]):

- [[Thurifer]]:
	- Add charcoal to [[Thurible]].
	- Refill the [[Incense Boat]] if needed.
- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]]:
	- Unfold and place a [[Corporal]], [[Monstrance Stand]], and [[Monstrance]] on the [[Crossing Altar]].
	- Light and place the [[Candelabra|Candelabrae]].
	- Light the [[Crossing Altar#Candles]].
	- Place a Holy Hour booklet on the second step at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].
	- Adjust the microphone so that it points West.
	- Relight [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] (as usual).

When finished, all [[Altar Server|Servers]] return to [[Choir Stalls#High]] and kneel until the [[#Ablutions]].

### Ablutions
As normal for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]]. Then:

- When the [[Celebrant]] returns to his chair, the [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] meet him and assist him in changing into his [[Cope]], then return to the [[Passageway]] and ready the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] and [[Processional Crucifix]].
 
### Postcommunion Prayer
- The [[Book Bearer]] bears the [[Prayers at the Chair]] book as normal.
- [[Thurifer]] imposes incense.

## Litany of Saints Procession
**Cue**: _Let us proceed in peace_. **In the name of Christ, Amen**.

- [[Book Bearer]] returns [[Prayers at the Chair]] book and heads immediately to [[Passageway]] and receives [[Processional Crucifix]] from an [[Acolyte]].
- When the [[Celebrant]] enters the [[Presbytery]] to kiss the [[High Altar]], [[Altar Server|Servers]] form up at the foot of the [[Presbytery]] facing East.
- When the [[Celebrant]] descends the [[High Altar]], [[Altar Server|Servers]] turn West and lead the [[Procession]] using the usual [[Procession#Formation]].
- Route:
	- West through the middle of the [[Sanctuary]], the [[Schola Cantorum]] joins.
	- Around the right/North side of the [[Crossing Altar]] and West out of the [[Sanctuary]].
	- West down the main aisle, turn right.
	- North toward the [[St. Patrick Chapel]], turn right.
	- East toward the [[Rosary Altar]], turn right.
	- South toward the [[Lourde's Door]], in front of the main pews. Do **not** stop to reverence when crossing the [[Sanctuary]]. Turn right.
	- West in the aisle between the main aisle and the confessionals toward the [[Holy Name Chapel]]. Turn right.
	- North toward the main aisle, turn right.
	- East up the main aisle.
- Pace: **very slow**. The goal is to form up in front of the [[Sanctuary]] by the end of the litany, without spending a ton of time standing there.

As the procession approaches the [[Sanctuary]], break formation:

- [[Thurifer]] stands square with the South side of the [[Crossing Altar]], where he would normally stand during [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]].
- [[Crucifer]], flanked by [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]], stand to the South side of the [[Crossing Altar]], facing North.
- [[Schola Cantorum]] splits the [[Crossing Altar]] and returns to the [[Choir Stalls]].
- [[Celebrant]] stands at the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]], where he would normally stand during [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]].

## Exposition
See [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Modifications for Exposition not following Mass]].

- All [[Reverence]] with the [[Celebrant]].
- [[Celebrant]] enters the [[Sanctuary]] to retrieve the Eucharist, all standby.
- [[Thurifer]] kneels when the [[Tabernacle]] door is opened, other [[Altar Server|Servers]] remain standing.
- Then, as usual for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament]] starting from [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Incensation]], with extra people standing by. [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] do not kneel.

### Exit
When finished, the [[Thurifer]] recesses through the [[Lourde's Door]], joined by [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]], then [[Celebrant]].

## After Mass
[[Thurifer]] moves the [[Thurible]] and [[Thurible Stand|Stand]] to its place for [[Benediction]], and adds charcoal around 7:45pm.

## Benediction
[[Benediction]] follows Holy Hour at 8pm. Only one [[Altar Server|Server]] is needed and it is done as normal.

## Cleanup
Snuff all candles immediately after [[Benediction]], as they need time to cool and harden before being switched for unbleached candles.
