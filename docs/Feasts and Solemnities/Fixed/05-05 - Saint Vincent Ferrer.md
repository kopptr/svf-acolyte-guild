# 05-05 - Saint Vincent Ferrer
This is a solemnity only because SVF is our patron. Dominicans celebrate it on May 5 (instead of April 5) so that it does not fall during the Octave of Easter or Holy Week[^dating].

[^dating]: In 2024, May 5th fell on a Sunday, so the anniversary of the dedication of [[Saint Vincent Ferrer Church]] was celebrated May 6th, and this feast was celebrated on May 7th.
