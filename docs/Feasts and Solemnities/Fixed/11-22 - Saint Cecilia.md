# 11-22 - Saint Cecilia
Saint Cecilia is the patroness of musicians and of our [[Schola Cantorum]], so this Memorial is celebrated with a [[Solemn Mass]].

## Overview

- [ ] [[High Altar#Angel Candles]] lit.

### Communion

- The [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] prepare the [[Crossing Altar]] for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]]. Since _Ablutions_ will occur at the [[High Altar]], complete preparations can be made immediately. See [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Peoples' Communion]].

### Postcommunion Prayer
- The [[Book Bearer]] holds the book as usual. The [[Thurifer]] stands nearby in front of the [[Choir Stalls]] between the [[Celebrant]] and the [[Presbytery]].
- After the _Postcommunion Prayer_, the [[Book Bearer]] then returns to his place in the [[Choir Stalls]].
- The [[Thurifer]] leads the [[Celebrant]] to the foot of the [[Sanctuary]] as at [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#If Exposition directly follows Mass]]. 
### Exposition
The [[Thurifer]] attends as at  [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#If Exposition directly follows Mass]]. Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] remain in [[Choir Stalls]].

### Recession
- The [[Thurifer]] leads the [[Celebrant]] out the [[Lourde's Door]].
- The other [[Altar Server|Servers]] remain in their [[Choir Stalls]] until the exit is complete, and then return to the [[Sacristy]] in an orderly fashion through the [[Passageway]] to meet the [[Celebrant]] and [[Thurifer]] for the [[Post-Mass Prayer with Ministers]].

## Benediction
See [[Benediction]], only one [[Altar Server|Server]] assists.
