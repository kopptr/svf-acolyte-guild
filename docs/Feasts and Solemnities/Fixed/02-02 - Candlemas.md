# 02-02 - Candlemas
_The Presentation of the Lord_.
## Overview
[[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], with:

- [[#Procession and Candle Blessing]].
- Omission of _Pentitential Rite_ / [[Kyrie]].
- [[#Oblation of Candles]] preceding the [[Offertory]].

This Mass is at the [[Crossing Altar]] (unlike most weekday solemnities which are celebrated at the [[High Altar]]) to facilitate the [[#Oblation of Candles]]. A [[Sequence]] is allowed before the [[Alleluia]][^ordo_sequence] (a [[Preservation of Dominican Customs|Dominican Custom]]), but we omit it.

## Preparation
- [ ] [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]].
- [ ] [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] placed at the church entrances.
- [ ] [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] for each [[Altar Server|Server]] placed at their seats in the [[Choir Stalls]].
- [ ] Candle planters placed in front of the [[Sanctuary]].
- [ ] [[Aspersorium]] placed at the head of the Nave (or should it be the [[Holy Name Chapel]]?).
- [ ] Candles owned by [[Altar Server|Servers]] or the people placed in the [[Holy Name Chapel]] before Mass.

## Procession and Candle Blessing

## Order of Mass
### Reverence to the Altar through Universal Prayer
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:

- _Penitential Rite_ and [[Kyrie]] are omitted.
- All extinguish their [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] after the _Collect_.
- In lieu of (or possibly in addition to) the _Universal Prayer_, the Candlemas Novena Prayer is said.

### Oblation of Candles
**Cue**: Candlemas Novena Prayer concludes.

- Four [[Altar Server|Servers]] light their own [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]], then take them up and down the aisles, lighting the peoples' candles (Two up and down the center, one each for the side aisles). One [[Altar Server|Server]] lights the [[Minister|Ministers]]' candles first.
- [[Altar Server|Servers]] return to the foot of [[Sanctuary]] and form up West of the candle planters, starting two lines.
- The [[Celebrant]] and any other [[Minister|Ministers]] exit the [[Sanctuary]], place their [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] in the planters, and reenter the [[Sanctuary]].
- The [[Altar Server|Servers]] place their [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] in the planters. The [[Crucifer]] and [[Thurifer]] return to their seats in the [[Sanctuary]].
- The two [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] attend to the two sides of the candle planters, directing the people as needed.
- The people place their [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] in the planters.
- When finished, the two [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] return to their place in the [[Sanctuary]] and the [[Offertory]] begins.

### Offertory through Dismissal
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]].
