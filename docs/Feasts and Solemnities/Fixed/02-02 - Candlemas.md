# 02-02 - Candlemas
_The Presentation of the Lord_.

## Overview
[[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], with:

- [[#Procession and Candle Blessing]].
- Omission of _Pentitential Rite_ / [[Kyrie]].
- [[#Oblation of Candles]] preceding the [[Offertory]].

This Mass is at the [[Crossing Altar]] (unlike most weekday solemnities which are celebrated at the [[High Altar]]) to facilitate the [[#Oblation of Candles]]. A [[Sequence]] is allowed before the [[Alleluia]][^ordo_sequence] (a [[Preservation of Dominican Customs|Dominican Custom]]), but we omit it.

## Roles
- [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]], [[Holy Water Bearer]]
- [[Crucifer]], [[Book Bearer]], [[Bell Ringer]]
- [[Thurifer]]
- [[Lucifer]] 1, [[Acolyte]] 1
- [[Lucifer]] 2, [[Acolyte]] 2

## Preparation
- [ ] [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Preparation]].
- [ ] [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] placed at the church entrances for the people.
- [ ] Candle oases placed in front of the [[Sanctuary]].
- [ ] Candles to be blessed (the [[Parish of St. Vincent Ferrer and St. Catherine of Siena|Parish]]'s, the people's, and the [[Altar Server|Servers]]') placed in the [[Holy Name Chapel]] before Mass.
- [ ] [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] for each [[Altar Server|Server]] and [[Minister]] placed at their seats in the [[Choir Stalls]] (except the [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]], who processes with his).
- [ ] [[Prayers at the Chair]] book placed at the back of the church, near the main aisle.
- [ ] [[Aspersorium]] placed at the back of the church, near the main aisle.

## Procession and Candle Blessing
- Order:
	- [[Thurifer]]
	- [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1, [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 2
	- [[Holy Water Bearer]] with [[Hand Candle]]
	- [[Schola Cantorum]]
	- [[Minister|Ministers]]
- First leg:
	- Incense is **not** imposed for the first leg.
	- Out the [[Lourde's Door]]
	- Turn left and head West down the side aisle.
		- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] light the people's candles as they process. Therefore the [[Thurifer]] must process **very** slowly.
		- [[Holy Water Bearer]], with a [[Hand Candle]], lights it from a [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]], and separates from the procession, crosses the front of the [[Sanctuary]], and heads West down the 66th Street aisle, lighting the peoples' candles. He joins the formation in the back of the church when finished.
	- Turn right, upon reaching the main aisle, break formation:
		- From South to North: [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1, [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 2, [[Thurifer]], [[Holy Water Bearer]], centered in the back of the church, backs against the main doors, facing East.
		- [[Minister|Ministers]], in the main aisle, flush with the last pew.
		- [[Schola Cantorum]], on the South side of the main aisle, backs against the West wall.
- [[Holy Water Bearer]] holds the [[Prayers at the Chair]] book for the introductory prayers and blessing of candles. He then deposits the [[Prayers at the Chair]] book on the back table.
- Aspersion of candles:
	- The [[Holy Water Bearer]] takes the [[Aspersorium]] and accompanies the [[Celebrant]], holding his [[Chasuble]] with his right hand and the [[Aspersorium]] with the left. Route is up to the [[Celebrant]]. In 2023 we did:
		- Up the main aisle.
		- Into the [[Sanctuary]] to the foot of the [[High Altar]].
		- Out of the [[Sanctuary]] and down the 66th Street aisle.
		- Into the [[Holy Name Chapel]].
		- Back to where it started.
	- All other [[Altar Server|Servers]] and the [[Schola Cantorum]] wait in place.
- Second leg:
	- When the [[Celebrant]] and [[Holy Water Bearer]] return, the [[Thurifer]] assists the [[Celebrant]] with imposing incense.
	- The [[Holy Water Bearer]] holds the [[Prayers at the Chair]] book for the prayer.
	- When it's finished, all proceed up the main aisle and into the [[Sanctuary]], as usual.
	- There is an additional antiphon before the _Introit_, but the [[Thurifer]] should lead the procession into the [[Sanctuary]] immediately, **without waiting for a music change**.

## Order of Mass
### Reverence to the Altar through Universal Prayer
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:

- Immediately after the [[Celebrant]] kisses the [[Altar]], the [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] assists him in removing his [[Cope]] and donning his [[Chasuble]].
- Then, the [[Thurifer]] assists with the incensation of the [[Altar]] as usual.
- _Penitential Rite_ and [[Kyrie]] are omitted; the [[Gloria]] immediately follows the incensation.
- The [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Missal]] for the _Collect_ as usual.
- All extinguish their [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] after the _Collect_.
- In lieu of (or possibly in addition to) the _Universal Prayer_, the Candlemas Novena Prayer is said.

### Oblation of Candles
**Cue**: Candlemas Novena Prayer concludes.

- All [[Altar Server|Servers]] light their own [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]], the first assists the [[Celebrant]] in lighting his.
- The [[Altar Server|Servers]] and [[Minister|Ministers]] exit the [[Sanctuary]], [[Genuflection|Genuflect]], and then split up and head down the various aisles, lighting the peoples' candles on their way.
- The [[Minister|Ministers]] and [[Altar Server|Servers]] meet in the back of the main aisle.
- The [[Celebrant]], then any other [[Minister|Ministers]], then [[Altar Server|Servers]], approach the candles oases up the main aisle.
- In order and in pairs, all [[Genuflection|Genuflect]], then deposit their [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] into an oasis, then enter the [[Sanctuary]] and take their seats. 
- The [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] and one other [[Altar Server|Server]] attend to the two sides of the candle oases, directing the people as needed.
- The people place their [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] in the oases.
- When finished, the [[Altar Server|Servers]] return to their place in the [[Sanctuary]] and the [[Offertory]] begins.

### Offertory through Dismissal
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]]. The [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]] and [[Thurifer]] must take around the candle oases during the [[Eucharistic Prayer]].
