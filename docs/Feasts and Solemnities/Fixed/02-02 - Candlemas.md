# 02-02 - Candlemas
_The Presentation of the Lord_.
## Overview
[[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], with:

- [[#Procession and Candle Blessing]].
- Omission of _Pentitential Rite_ / [[Kyrie]].
- [[#Oblation of Candles]] preceding the [[Offertory]].

This Mass is at the [[Crossing Altar]] (unlike most weekday solemnities which are celebrated at the [[High Altar]]) to facilitate the [[#Oblation of Candles]]. A [[Sequence]] is allowed before the [[Alleluia]][^ordo_sequence] (a [[Preservation of Dominican Customs|Dominican Custom]]), but we omit it.

## Roles
- [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]], [[Holy Water Bearer]]
- [[Crucifer]], [[Book Bearer]], [[Bell Ringer]]
- [[Thurifer]]
- [[Lucifer]] 1, [[Acolyte]] 1
- [[Lucifer]] 2, [[Acolyte]] 2

## Preparation
- [ ] [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Preparation]].
- [ ] [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] placed at the church entrances.
- [ ] [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] for each [[Altar Server|Server]] and [[Minister]] placed at their seats in the [[Choir Stalls]] (except the [[MC]], who processes with his).
- [ ] Candle planters placed in front of the [[Sanctuary]].
- [ ] [[Ritual|Ceremonial]] placed at the back of the church, near the main aisle (unless the [[Celebrant]] prefers to read from the pamphlet).
- [ ] Candles owned by [[Altar Server|Servers]] or the people placed in the [[Holy Name Chapel]] before Mass.

## Procession and Candle Blessing
- Order:
	- [[Thurifer]]
	- [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1, [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 2
	- [[Holy Water Bearer]] with [[Aspersorium]] and [[Hand Candle]]
	- [[Schola Cantorum]]
	- [[Minister|Ministers]]
- First leg:
	- Out the [[Lourde's Door]]
	- Turn left and head West down the side aisle.
		- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] light the people's candles as they process. Therefore the [[Thurifer]] must process **very** slowly.
		- [[Holy Water Bearer]], with a [[Hand Candle]], lights it from a [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]], and separates from the procession, crosses the front of the [[Sanctuary]], and heads West down the 66th Street aisle, lighting the peoples' candles. He joins the formation in the back of the church when finished.
	- Turn right, upon reaching the main aisle, break formation:
		- From North to South: [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]], [[Thurifer]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1, [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 2, on the North side of the main aisle, backs against the West wall.
		- [[Minister|Ministers]], in the main aisle, flush with the last pew.
		- [[Schola Cantorum]], on the South side of the main aisle, backs against the West wall.
- The [[Celebrant]] gives the greeting and says the blessing. [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] holds the [[Ritual|Ceremonial]] if needed.
- Aspersion of candles:
	- The [[Holy Water Bearer]] takes the [[Aspersorium]] and accompanies the [[Celebrant]], holding his [[Chasuble]] with his right hand and the [[Aspersorium]] with the left. Route is up the main aisle, back down the 66th Street aisle, into the [[Holy Name Chapel]], and then back to where it started.
	- All other [[Altar Server|Servers]] and the [[Schola Cantorum]] wait in place.
- Second leg:
	- When the [[Celebrant]] and [[Holy Water Bearer]] return, all form up, and the [[Thurifer]] assists the [[Celebrant]] with imposing incense.
	- All proceed up the main aisle and into the [[Sanctuary]], as usual.
	- There is an additional antiphon before the _Introit_, but the [[Thurifer]] should lead the procession into the [[Sanctuary]] immediately, without waiting for a music change.

## Order of Mass
### Reverence to the Altar through Universal Prayer
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:

- _Penitential Rite_ and [[Kyrie]] are omitted.
- All extinguish their [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] after the _Collect_.
- In lieu of (or possibly in addition to) the _Universal Prayer_, the Candlemas Novena Prayer is said.

### Oblation of Candles
**Cue**: Candlemas Novena Prayer concludes.

- All [[Altar Server|Servers]] light their own [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]], then take them up and down the aisles, lighting the peoples' candles (Two up and down the center, two up and down the 66th Street aisle, one up and down the 65th Street aisle). One [[Altar Server|Server]] lights the [[Minister|Ministers]]' candles first.
- [[Altar Server|Servers]] return to the foot of [[Sanctuary]] and form up West of the candle planters, starting two lines.
- The [[Celebrant]] and any other [[Minister|Ministers]] exit the [[Sanctuary]], place their [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] in the planters, and reenter the [[Sanctuary]].
- The [[Altar Server|Servers]] place their [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] in the planters.
- The two [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] attend to the two sides of the candle planters, directing the people as needed. The other [[Altar Server|Servers]] return to their seats.
- The people place their [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] in the planters.
- When finished, the two [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] return to their place in the [[Sanctuary]] and the [[Offertory]] begins.

### Offertory through Dismissal
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]].
