While priest is blessing the ashes with Water, [[Thurifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] approach. When done, all servers line up for ashes as at Communion #todo how is this not awkward?

When finished receiving ashes, [[Thurifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] return to [[Choir Stalls#High]], [[Crucifer]] returns to [[Choir Stalls#Low]].

When Ministers are finished imposing ashes, [[Crucifer]] assists Ministers with cleaning hands.
