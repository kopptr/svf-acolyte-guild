# Pentecost
_Pentecost Sunday_.

## Overview
[[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], with:

- The [[High Altar#Angel Candles]] may be lit.
- The _Veni Creator Spiritus_ Sequence is sung immediately after the [[Alleluia]][^cotly326]. The _Gospel Procession_ should begin part way through the Sequence to account for the timing.
- If there are sufficient [[Altar Server|Servers]], four [[Torch|Torches]] and a [[Boat Bearer]] may be used for the [[Eucharistic Prayer]].

## Miscellaneous Notes
[[Ceremonies of the Liturgical Year|CotLY > par. 328]] suggests a procession of the Paschal candle to the Baptistery on the last Mass of Pentecost.
