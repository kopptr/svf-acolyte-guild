# Pentecost Vigil
_The Vigil Mass of Pentecost_.
## Overview
[[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]]:

- Beginning with lowest [[Church Lights]] setting, at the [[#Gloria]] the full [[Church Lights]] setting is turned on.
- There is no _Processional Hymn_, so the short entrance is used.
- Lit [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] are used during the _Introductory Rites_ and the [[#General Renewal of Baptismal Promises]].
- [[#Sacramental Rites]].
- [[Credo]] is omitted (due to the [[#General Renewal of Baptismal Promises]]).
- A Pentecost-specific variant of Eucharistic Prayer I is used[^cotly326].
- Those who received Baptism, Confirmation, or who were received into the Church, receive [[#Communion]] immediately after the [[Priest|Priests]], before the [[Altar Server|Altar Servers]] and the rest of the congregation.
- Double _Alleluia_ is used at the dismissal, to mirror that of Easter[^cotly326].
