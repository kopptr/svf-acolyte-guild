## Order of Mass

### Entrance
Mass will start when everyone is in place near the firepit on 66th Street near the [[Rosary Altar]] entrance. All of the [[Altar Server|Servers]] should go there in an orderly fashion, holding what they need for the [[#Lucernarium]]:

- [[Thurifer]] has **unlit** [[Thurible]].
- [[Boat Bearer]] has [[Incense Boat]] and tongs/weenie roaster.
- [[Ignifer]] 1 has shortest [[Taper]].
- [[Ignifer]] 2 has tongs and weenie roaster.
- [[Book Bearer]] 1 bears [[Missal]] and carries it in procession.
- A [[Priest]], not the [[Celebrant]], carries the [[Paschal Candle]].
- Everyone else holds [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]]. [[Ignifer|Ignifers]] 3-5 carry four extra [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] between them, one each for [[Celebrant]], [[Deacon]], [[Boat Bearer]], and [[Ignifer]] 2.

Form up:

- [[Book Bearer]] 1 near [[Celebrant]].
- [[Thurifer]], [[Boat Bearer]], and [[Ignifer]] 1 with an easy path to the fire.
- Everyone else in two lines out of the way.

### Lucernarium
A.k.a. Service of Light.

Mass begins when the [[Celebrant]] starts the prayers.

#### Blessing of Fire and Preparation of the Candle
- [[Book Bearer]] 1 holds [[Missal]] for the lighting and blessing of the fire.
- After the fire is lit and blessed[^charcoal_timing], and the preparation of the [[Paschal Candle]] is taking place, [[Thurifer]] and [[Ignifer]] 2 **discreetly** light [[Thurible]]:
	- Both approach the fire. [[Thurifer]] holds [[Thurible]] open.
	- [[Ignifer]] 2 uses tongs/weenie roaster to take charcoal brickettes from [[Thurible]], light them in the fire, and place them back in the [[Thurible]].
	- When finished, [[Thurifer]] closes [[Thurible]], [[Ignifer]] 2 leaves the weenie roaster, and both return to their place.
	- [[Ignifer]] 2 pockets the tongs, or holds them in his off hand.
- [[Book Bearer]] 1 continues to hold [[Missal]] for the preparation of the [[Paschal Candle]].
- When the preparation of the [[Paschal Candle]] is finished, [[Ignifer]] 1 lights the [[Taper]] from the fire and hands it to the [[Celebrant]]. Celebrant lights the [[Paschal Candle]] and hands the [[Taper]] back, which [[Ignifer]] 1 extinguishes.

[^charcoal_timing]: [[The Roman Missal]] says not to do this until the [[Paschal Candle]] is lit, but if we do that, then the coals won't be properly lit for the procession.

#### Procession
- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] go to [[Celebrant]] to charge incense. **[[Boat Bearer]] gives boat to [[Thurifer]] when done**.
- [[Ignifer|Ignifers]] give extra [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] to [[Boat Bearer]], [[Ignifer]] 2, [[Celebrant]], and [[Deacon]].
- **Formation**:
	- [[Thurifer]]
	- [[Priest]] with [[Paschal Candle]].
	- [[Altar Server|Servers]] in pairs.  [[Ignifer|Ignifers]] 1-5 first, [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] and [[Book Bearer]] are last.
	- Other [[Minister|Ministers]].
- **Route**: Three legs, each stopping for _Christ our light_/**Thanks be to God**:
	1. Just outside (inside?) the 66th St. door.
	2. Into the church through the 66th St. entrance. West down the 66th St. aisle, South across the back of the church, stop at the back of the main aisle, facing the [[Sanctuary]].
		- [[Ignifer]] 1 lights [[Taper]] from [[Paschal Candle]], and all [[Altar Server|Servers]]' and [[Minister|Ministers]] [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] are lit.
		- [[Ignifer|Ignifers]] 1-5 use [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]]/[[Taper|Tapers]] and spread out, one on every edge of the main sets of pews. They start lighting peoples' [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] from the back moving forward, keeping pace with the [[Paschal Candle]].
		- Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] continue in procession behind the [[Paschal Candle]].
	3. To the foot of the [[Sanctuary]]. [[Thurifer]] stands off to the North side during intonation.
		- [[Paschal Candle]] goes to its stand in front of the [[Ambo]]. [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] accompanies it to spot the [[Priest]], then returns to his seat.
		- Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] enter the [[Sanctuary]] in pairs, forming up in the middle and making a [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] before entering and going up the North side of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]].
			- [[Boat Bearer]] extinguishes his [[Hand Candle]], takes up the [[Incense Boat]], and goes to the [[Celebrant]]'s chair with the [[Thurifer]] and stands by.
			- [[Thurifer]] goes to the [[Celebrant]]'s chair with the [[Boat Bearer]] and stands by.
			- [[Ignifer]] 5 goes to the [[Sacristy]] by way of the [[Passageway]], and waits near the [[Lourde's Door]] (so that he can hear).
			- All others deposit their items and stand in [[Choir Stalls#Low]] with lit [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]].

#### Exsultet
- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] assist with [[Imposition of Incense]]. [[Boat Bearer]] holds [[Celebrant]]'s and [[Deacon]]'s [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] during imposition of incense and bears [[Incense Boat]] as usual.
- When finished, [[Boat Bearer]] returns [[Hand Candle]] to [[Celebrant]] and returns to his seat.
- [[Thurifer]] then precedes whomever will proclaim the [[#Exsultet]]:
	- To the [[Paschal Candle]], to be incensed.
	- To the [[High Ambo]] to incense.
	- **Immediately after the incensation**, [[Thurifer]] descends the [[High Ambo]], puts away the [[Thurible]], and returns to his seat.
- [[Ignifer]] 5 waits until the completion of the _Exsultet_, and then turns on the minimal configuration of lights required for the [[Schola Cantorum]] to see their music. Then he returns to the [[Choir Stalls]] by way of the [[Passageway]].
- All other [[Altar Server|Servers]] remain in [[Choir Stalls#Low]] with [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] lit, facing the [[Ambo]].
 
### Liturgy of the Word
Extinguish [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] when the pamphlet says to / when the [[Celebrant]] does.

#### Lessons
[[Book Bearer]] 1 bears [[Missal]] for the greeting and the introduction of the readings. He then bears it for the prayers following each psalm after each reading. All other [[Altar Server|Servers]] remain in [[Choir Stalls#Low]], sitting/standing at the appropriate times.

**Before the _Gloria_**:

- _Toward the end of the second-last lesson_, [[Ignifer]] 5 exits to the [[Sacristy]] by way of the [[Passageway]], making a [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] along the way.
- _Just after the last lesson, during the prayer_, [[Ignifer]] 1 lights a [[Taper]] from the [[Paschal Candle]] and waits near the [[Paschal Candle]].
#### Gloria
During the _Gloria_, one team of [[Altar Server|Servers]] lights candles, another rings [[Hand Bells]].

##### Bells
- [[Hand Bells]] rung by [[Bell Ringer|Bell Ringers]] 2 and 3.
- Consult James for precisely when to ring, likely the same as at [[07 - Holy Thursday#Gloria|Holy Thursday > Gloria]]. #liturgy-todo 

##### Candles
Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] light candles and turn on [[Church Lights]]. **There are many candles. This should be done quickly, though still in a dignified manner**. The goal is to finish lighting everything and for [[Altar Server|Servers]] to be back to their seats before the sung _Gloria_ ends.

When _Gloria_ is intoned:

- [[Ignifer]] 1 enters the [[Sanctuary]], 2-4 light [[Taper|Tapers]] from [[Ignifer]] 1.
- [[Ignifer|Ignifers]] 1 and 2, light:
	- Two [[Sanctuary#Polychrome Candles]] closer to [[Crossing Altar]].
	- [[Crossing Altar#Candles]].
	- [[Holy Name Chapel]] [[Altar]] candles and sconces, and turn on the lights.
		- Form up at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]], [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]], and head West down the 65th St. aisle.
	- [[St. Patrick Chapel]] [[Altar]] candles and sconces, and turn on the lights.
	- [[St. Joseph Chapel]] [[Altar]] candles and sconces, and turn on the lights.
	- [[Rosary Altar]] candles and sconces, and **open the sepulchre door**.
	- [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]].
- [[Ignifer|Ignifers]] 3 and 4, with longest [[Taper|Tapers]], light:
	- [[High Altar#Candles]].
	- [[High Altar#Angel Candles]].
	- Two [[Sanctuary#Polychrome Candles]] in the [[Presbytery]].
	- Start at the end of the list for [[Ignifer|Ignifers]] 1 and 2 and work backwards, helping if needed.
	- They may use the stools to assist in lighting the candles.
- [[Ignifer]] 5:
	- Turn on the [[Church Lights]] to the _Solemn Mass_ setting.
	- Take up and light the nearby [[Taper]].
	- Light the [[Friars' Chapel#Rood]] candles via the catwalk.
	- Light the [[Friars' Chapel]] [[Altar]] candles.
- **DO NOT light the [[Sanctuary#Lamps]]**.
- All return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]] when finished and extinguish [[Taper|Tapers]].
- If the music gets to _Jesu Christe_ before the [[Altar Server|Servers]] are finished, they should abandon what they're doing and return to the [[Choir Stalls]].

#### Collect

#### Epistle, Gradual, Alleluia, Gospel, Homily
Same as usual, except:

- Gospel Procession uses incense, but **does not use [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]]**.

#### Baptismal Liturgy

After the _Homily_ when the [[Celebrant]] stands, the [[Altar Server|Servers]] all go directly to the Baptismal font, and stand in two lines under the [[High Ambo]]. See [[#Order]] to know what to carry. The [[Celebrant]] calls forth the _Baptismandi_, and the procession starts.
##### Procession
_Litany of the Saints_ is sung during procession.

###### Leader

- Turn right, head to the [[Baptismal Font]].
- [[Altar Server|Servers]] stand between [[Baptismal Font]] and [[Sanctuary]], out of the way, while others file in and when not needed.

##### Blessing of Water

##### Renewal of Baptismal Promises
- Godparents light the newly baptized's [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]].

- [[Book Bearer]] 1 bears [[Missal]].
- [[Holy Water Bearer]] helps [[Celebrant]] fill the [[Aspersorium]], and then bears it with him as he moves about the church, sprinkling. Route:
		- Down Confessional aisle
		- Up [[Rosary Altar]] aisle
		- Newly baptized will join in the procession after the [[Celebrant]]. No other servers join.
		- Down [[Friars' Chapel]] aisle
		- Up main aisle.

##### Profession of Faith
Whereby non-Catholic-but-baptized people are received into the church.
- [[Book Bearer]] 2 bears the [[Ritual]].

- At _Sanctus_, six [[Altar Server|Servers]] line up at the foot of the altar, see [[Eucharistic Prayer#Formation]].

#### Communion
