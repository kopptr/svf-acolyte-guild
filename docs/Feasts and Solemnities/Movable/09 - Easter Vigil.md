## Order of Mass

### Lucernarium
A.k.a. Service of Light.

#### Entrance
This is not a procession or solemn entrance. The Lucernarium starts when everyone is in place and the [[Celebrant]] starts the prayers.

Go to the 66th St. Entrance outside near the ramp. Move so as to be hidden: leave the [[Sacristy]] through the [[Baptistery]] into the [[Narthex]], then out the 66th St. door in the [[Narthex]], and East on 66th St. to the entrance near the [[Rosary Altar]]:

- [[Thurifer]] has **unlit** [[Thurible]].
- [[Boat Bearer]] has boat and tongs/weenie roaster.
- [[Lucifer]] 1 has shortest [[Taper]].
- [[Book Bearer]] 1 bears [[Missal]] and carries it in procession.
- A [[Priest]], not the [[Celebrant]], carries the [[Paschal Candle]].
- Everyone else holds [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]]. Someone should have extra [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] for Celebrant, Deacon, and [[Boat Bearer]].

Form up:

- [[Book Bearer]] 1 near priest.
- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] with an easy path to the fire.
- Everyone else in two lines out of the way.

#### Blessing of Fire and Preparation of the Candle
- [[Book Bearer]] 1 holds [[Missal]] for the lighting and blessing of the fire.
- After the fire is lit and blessed, [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] light [[Thurible]]:
	- This action is done **discreetly**, as the preparation of the [[Paschal Candle]] will have begun.
	- Both approach the fire. [[Thurifer]] holds [[Thurible]] open.
	- [[Boat Bearer]] uses tongs/weenie roaster to take charcoal brickettes from [[Thurible]], light them in the fire, and place them back in the [[Thurible]].
	- When finished, [[Thurifer]] closes [[Thurible]] and both return to their place.
	- [[Boat Bearer]] pockets the tongs, or holds them in his off hand.
- [[Book Bearer]] 1 continues to hold [[Missal]] for the preparation of the [[Paschal Candle]].
- When finished, [[Lucifer]] 1 lights the [[Taper]] from the fire and hands it to the [[Celebrant]]. Celebrant lights the [[Paschal Candle]] and hands the [[Taper]] back, which [[Lucifer]] 1 extinguishes.

#### Procession
- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] go to [[Celebrant]] to charge incense. **[[Boat Bearer]] gives boat to [[Thurifer]] when done**, and then takes a [[Hand Candle]].
- [[Thurifer]] leads the procession alone, followed by the [[Paschal Candle]], followed by the other [[Altar Server|Servers]], then everyone else. Three legs, each stopping for _Christ our light_/**Thanks be to God**:
	1. Just outside the 66th St. Door:
		- Servers other than the [[Thurifer]] form up behind in pairs.
		- [[Lucifer]], with [[Taper]], is in the first pair.
		- [[Book Bearer]] 1, with [[Missal]], and [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] in the last pair.
	2. Into the church through the 66th St. Entrance. West down the 66th St. aisle, South toward the rear entrance, stop at the back of the church, facing the [[Sanctuary]].
		- [[Lucifer]] 1 lights [[Taper]] from [[Paschal Candle]], and all servers' [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] are lit.
		- Five [[Altar Server|Servers]], not the [[Thurifer]] or [[Book Bearer]] 1, use [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]]/[[Taper|Tapers]] and spread out, one on every edge of the main sets of pews. They start lighting peoples' [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] from the back moving forward. Only light every third or fifth person's [[Hand Candle]] so as to keep pace with the moving [[Paschal Candle]].
		- [[Altar Server|Servers]] not lighting the peoples' [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] continue in procession behind the [[Paschal Candle]].
	4. To the foot of the [[Sanctuary]]. [[Thurifer]] stands off to the North side during intonation.
		- [[Thurifer]] leads [[Paschal Candle]] to its stand in front of the ambo.
		- Other servers enter the [[Sanctuary]] and go to their seats in [[Choir Stalls#Low]]. Enter in pairs, making a [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] before entering and going up the North side of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]].
			- [[Boat Bearer]] returns tongs/weenie roaster to [[Thurible Stand]].
			- [[Book Bearer]] 1 returns [[Missal]] to stand in [[Choir Stalls#Low]].
			- [[Lucifer]] 1 returns [[Taper]].
			- All stand in [[Choir Stalls#Low]] with lit [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]], facing the [[Ambo]] where the [[#Exsultet]] is to be sung.
		- When [[Paschal Candle]] is in place, [[Thurifer]] returns to [[Choir Stalls]] by most direct route.

#### Exsultet
- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] go to [[Celebrant]] at his chair so he can impose incense.
	- [[Boat Bearer]] holds [[Celebrant]]'s [[Hand Candle]] during imposition of incense and bears [[Incense Boat]] as usual.
- When finished, [[Boat Bearer]] returns [[Hand Candle]] to [[Celebrant]] and returns to his seat.
- [[Thurifer]] then precedes whomever will proclaim the [[#Exsultet]]:
	- To the [[Paschal Candle]], to be incensed.
	- To the [[Ambo]], likely high one, to incense.
	- Should he remain for the [[#Exsultet]], or go back immediately after the incensation? #liturgy-todo  Blue book says he leaves right away, but it'd be smokier if he stayed.
- All other [[Altar Server|Servers]] remain in [[Choir Stalls#Low]] with [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] lit, facing the [[Ambo]].
 
### Liturgy of the Word
Extinguish [[Hand Candle|Hand Candles]] when the pamphlet says to / when the [[Celebrant]] does.

#### Lessons
[[Book Bearer]] 1 bears [[Missal]] for the greeting and the introduction of the readings. He then bears it for the prayers following each psalm after each reading. All other [[Altar Server|Servers]] remain in [[Choir Stalls#Low]], sitting/standing at the appropriate times.

#### Gloria
During the _Gloria_, one team of servers lights candles, another rings bells.

##### Bells
- Bells rung by [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]].
- Consult James for precisely when to ring, likely the same as at [[07 - Holy Thursday#Gloria|Holy Thursday > Gloria]]. #liturgy-todo 

##### Candles
Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] light candles and turn on [[Church Lights]]. **There are a lot of candles. This should be done quickly, though still in a dignified manner**. The goal is to finish lighting everything and be back to our seats before the sung _Gloria_ ends.

- **Before the _Gloria_, during the prayer after the last lesson**:
	- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] 1 and 4 take [[Taper|Tapers]], light them from the [[Paschal Candle]], and form up at the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]].
	- [[Lucifer]] 5 grabs a [[Taper]], approaches the [[Presbytery]], [[Inclination#Major Inclination]] to the [[High Altar]], then enters the [[Sacristy]] and heads for the circuit breakers.
- When _Gloria_ is intoned:
	- [[Lucifer]] 5 turns on all the [[Church Lights]]. When finished, grab a [[Taper]] and help the others.
		- "Solemn Mass" setting.
	- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] 2 and 3 leave the [[Choir Stalls]], get [[Taper|Tapers]], and standby.
	- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] 1 and 4 [[Inclination#Major Inclination]] to the [[Crossing Altar]], then enter the [[Sanctuary]] to its left.
	- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] 1 and 4 light the other [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] [[Taper|Tapers]].
	- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] 1-5 light these candles (divvy up who lights what during rehearsal):
		- [[High Altar#Candles]].
		- [[High Altar#Angel Candles]].
		- Four [[Sanctuary#Polychrome Candles]].
		- [[Crossing Altar#Candles]]. 
		- [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]].
		- [[Rosary Altar]] candles.
		- [[Friars' Chapel#Rood]] candles.
		- [[Friars' Chapel]] candles.
		- [[St. Joseph Chapel]] altar candles.
		- [[St. Patrick Chapel]] altar candles.
		- [[Holy Name Chapel]] altar candles.
		- **DO NOT light the [[Sanctuary#Lamps]]**.
- All return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]] when finished and extinguish [[Taper|Tapers]].
- If you hear _Jesu Christe_, just quit and return to your [[Choir Stalls]].
