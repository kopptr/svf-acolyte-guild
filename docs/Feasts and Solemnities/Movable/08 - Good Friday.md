- The [[Minister|Ministers]] prostrate, and the [[Altar Server|Servers]] and people kneel while they do so.
- The [[Minister|Ministers]] and [[Altar Server|Servers]] stand, all [[Reverence]], and enter the [[Sanctuary]].

### Opening Prayers
[[Book Bearer]] attends with [[Missal]] for the whole opening sequence.

### Readings, Gradual, Tract, Gospel, Homily
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except that, as at [[06 - Palm Sunday|Palm Sunday]], there is no _Gospel Procession_, using neither [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] nor incense. Kneel at the appropriate time during the _Gospel_.

### Solemn Intercessions
- If the [[Priest]] prefers to read at the [[Altar]] (Confirmed for 2024):
	- [[Book Bearer]] places [[Missal]] on the [[Altar]] for the _Solemn Intercessions_, then returns to the [[Choir Stalls]].
	- All [[Altar Server|Servers]] kneel/stand at _Let us kneel_/_Let us stand_.
	- [[Book Bearer]] retrieves the [[Missal]] after _Solemn Intercessions_.
- If the [[Priest]] prefers to read from his seat:
	- [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Missal]] for the _Solemn Intercessions_.
	- All [[Altar Server|Servers]], except the [[Book Bearer]], kneel/stand at _Let us kneel_/_Let us stand_.

### Adoration of the Holy Cross
Prepare:

- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]]:
	- **Take off shoes**.
	- Go to the [[Sacristy]] with [[Minister|Ministers]] by way of the [[Passageway]].
	- Light and carry the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]].
- All other [[Altar Server|Servers]]:
	- Remain in [[Choir Stalls#Low]] and **remove shoes**. Leave shoes in [[Choir Stalls]].

#### Procession
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank [[Veneration Crucifix]] with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]].
- Three stops. At each, _Behold the wood of the cross_ / **Come let us adore him**.
	1. Process from [[Lourde's Door]] to foot of [[Crossing Altar]].
	2. Process to the middle of the [[Sanctuary]].
	3. Process into the [[Presbytery]] and to the foot of the [[High Altar]].
- [[Priest]] stands on the steps of the [[Presbytery]] holding the [[Veneration Crucifix]]. [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank him, turned inward, with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]], where they stand for the duration of the [[#Friars' Veneration]].

#### Friars' Veneration
Friars venerate the [[Veneration Crucifix]] in pairs, making three [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] along the way. All [[Altar Server|Servers]] other than [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] standby, seated in the [[Choir Stalls]].

- First pair of friars start in [[Sanctuary]] close to the people, and [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] together, facing the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- First pair moves to middle of [[Sanctuary]], second pair fills in their place. All pairs of friars time their genuflection and movement together.
- First moves to the [[Veneration Crucifix]], second pair fills in first pair's place, third pair fills in second pair's place. All three pairs make [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] together, the first pair kissing the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- First pair turns outward and files back to the [[Choir Stalls]], fourth pair moves in.

#### Peoples' Veneration
When finished:

- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank [[Veneration Crucifix]] with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] as [[Priest]] processes with it, down to the foot of the [[Altar]].
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] place the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] to the side of the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] 1 and 2 follow closely behind with purificators, standing at either side and wiping while the people reverence.
- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] 3 and 4 take purificators, enter the [[Sacristy]] by way of the [[Passageway]], and meet up with the [[Priest]] with the second [[Veneration Crucifix]]. Accompany him to the [[Friars' Chapel]] and attend to the second veneration station.
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] directs the people as needed.
- When everyone at a station is finished, attending [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] and [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] reverence the crucifix. If at the secondary station, assist the [[Priest]] in returning the [[Veneration Crucifix]] to the [[Sacristy]], and then return to the [[Choir Stalls]]. If at the primary station, retrieve the bracket and set it on the top step, and assist the [[Priest]] in placing it there.
- [[Veneration Crucifix]] and [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] remain for the remainder of the liturgy.
- All return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]] and don shoes.

	- Bring the [[Burse]] and spread the [[Corporal]] on the altar. Return the [[Burse]] to the [[Credence Table]].
	- Return to [[Choir Stalls]].

	- Meanwhile, [[Priest|Priests]] will retrieve more Eucharist from the [[Sacristy]].
- All return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]].
- After the [[Priest]] receives communion, receive communion as usual.
	- No bell is rung nor [[Crotalus]] clapped when he receives.
- After communion, a [[Minister]] takes the Eucharist to the back of the [[Tabernacle]] in the [[Sacristy]].

Genuflect to the cross with [[Minister|Ministers]]. Exit through the [[Lourde's Door]], with the leftmost servers moving first past the [[Minister|Ministers]] to meet up with the rightmost servers. (As in the [[Dominican Rite]]).
