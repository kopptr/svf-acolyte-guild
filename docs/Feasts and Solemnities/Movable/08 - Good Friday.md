### Entrance
All [[Altar Server|Servers]] except [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] start in [[Choir Stalls#Low]].

- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]], empty-handed, clap the [[Crotalus]] and precede the [[Minister|Ministers]] through the [[Lourde's Door]] and proceed directly to the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].
- Form up at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]]: [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1, [[Priest]], [[Deacon]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 2.
- The [[Minister|Ministers]] prostrate, and the [[Altar Server|Servers]] and people kneel while they do so.
- The [[Minister|Ministers]] and [[Altar Server|Servers]] stand, [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]], and enter the [[Sanctuary]].

### Opening Prayers
[[Book Bearer]] attends with [[Missal]] immediately for the whole opening sequence.

### Readings, Gradual, Tract, Gospel, Homily
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:

- There is no _Gospel Procession_, using neither [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] nor incense.
- Kneel at the appropriate time during the _Gospel_.

### Solemn Intercessions
- If the [[Priest]] prefers to read at the [[Altar]] (Confirmed for 2024):
	- [[Book Bearer]] places [[Missal]] on the [[Altar]] for the _Solemn Intercessions_, then returns to the [[Choir Stalls]].
	- All [[Altar Server|Servers]] kneel/stand at _Let us kneel_/_Let us stand_.
	- [[Book Bearer]] retrieves the [[Missal]] after _Solemn Intercessions_.
- If the [[Priest]] prefers to read from his seat:
	- [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Missal]] for the _Solemn Intercessions_.
	- All [[Altar Server|Servers]], except the [[Book Bearer]], kneel/stand at _Let us kneel_/_Let us stand_.

### Adoration of the Holy Cross
Prepare:

- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]]:
	- **Take off shoes**, leaving them in the [[Choir Stalls]].
	- Go to the [[Sacristy]] with [[Minister|Ministers]] by way of the [[Passageway]], making a [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] along the way.
	- Light and carry the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]].
- All other [[Altar Server|Servers]]:
	- Remain in [[Choir Stalls#Low]] and **remove shoes**. Leave shoes in [[Choir Stalls]].

#### Procession
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank [[Veneration Crucifix]] with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]].
- Three stops. At each, _Behold the wood of the cross_ / **Come let us adore him**.
	1. Process from [[Lourde's Door]] to foot of [[Crossing Altar]].
	2. Process to the middle of the [[Sanctuary]], centered between the [[Choir Stalls]].
	3. Process into the [[Presbytery]] and to the foot of the [[High Altar]].
- [[Priest]] stands on the steps of the [[Presbytery]] holding the [[Veneration Crucifix]]. [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank him, turned inward, with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]], where they stand for the duration of the [[#Friars' Veneration]].

#### Friars' Veneration
Friars venerate the [[Veneration Crucifix]] in pairs, making three [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] along the way. All [[Altar Server|Servers]] other than [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] standby, seated in the [[Choir Stalls]].

- First pair of friars start in [[Sanctuary]] close to the people, and [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] together, facing the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- First pair moves to middle of [[Sanctuary]], second pair fills in their place. All pairs of friars time their genuflection and movement together.
- First moves to the [[Veneration Crucifix]], second pair fills in first pair's place, third pair fills in second pair's place. All three pairs make [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] together, the first pair kissing the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- First pair turns outward and files back to the [[Choir Stalls]], fourth pair moves in.

#### Peoples' Veneration
When finished:

- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank [[Veneration Crucifix]] with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] as [[Priest]] processes with it, down to the foot of the [[Altar]].
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] place the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] to either side of the [[Veneration Crucifix]], on the [[Sanctuary]] steps.
- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] 1 and 2 follow closely behind with purificators, standing at either side and wiping while the people reverence.
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] venerate in a pair simultaneously, to show the people how to do it, then return to [[Choir Stalls]] and sit.
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] directs the people as needed.
- When everyone at a station is finished, attending [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] and [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] reverence the crucifix. Retrieve the bracket and set it on the top step, and assist the [[Priest]] in placing it there.
- [[Veneration Crucifix]] and [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] remain for the remainder of the liturgy.
- All return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]] and don shoes.

	- Spread the altar cloth.
	- Place the [[Missal]] on the [[Altar]].
	- Bring the [[Burse]] and spread the [[Corporal]] on the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]]. Return the [[Burse]] to the [[Credence Table]].

	- Meanwhile, [[Priest|Priests]] retrieve more Eucharist from the [[Sacristy]].
	- [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] assists [[Deacon]] and other [[Priest|Priests]] with [[Humeral Veil]] as needed.
- All return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]].
- After the [[Priest]] receives communion, receive communion as usual.

### Prayer after Communion and Prayer over the People

### Recession
Form up at the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]], everyone empty-handed, in a large line across the front, with space for [[Minister|Ministers]] in the middle. Genuflect to the cross with [[Minister|Ministers]]. Exit through the [[Lourde's Door]], with the leftmost servers moving first past the [[Minister|Ministers]] to meet up with the rightmost servers. (As in the [[Dominican Rite]]).

## Cleanup
- [[Veneration Crucifix]] in bracket and two lit [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] remain.
- Two [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] from the [[Crossing Altar]] move by the [[Veneration Crucifix]], so as to make a "V".
- Altar cloth rolled up (not folded) and brought back to [[Sacristy]].
