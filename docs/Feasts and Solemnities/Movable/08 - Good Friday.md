## Order of Liturgy

### Entrance
All [[Altar Server|Servers]] except [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] start in [[Choir Stalls#Low]].

- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]], empty-handed, clap the [[Crotalus]] and precede the [[Minister|Ministers]] through the [[Lourde's Door]] and proceed directly to the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].
- Form up at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]]: [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1, [[Priest]], [[Deacon]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 2.
- The [[Minister|Ministers]] prostrate, and the [[Altar Server|Servers]] and people kneel while they do so.
- The [[Minister|Ministers]] and [[Altar Server|Servers]] stand, [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]], and enter the [[Sanctuary]].

### Opening Prayers
[[Book Bearer]] attends with [[Missal]] immediately for the whole opening sequence.

### Readings, Gradual, Tract, Gospel, Homily
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:

- There is no _Gospel Procession_, using neither [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] nor incense.
- During the _Tract_, an [[Acolyte]] places the [[Hockey Puck Mic]] on the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]], unmutes it, and returns to his [[Choir Stalls|Choir Stall]].
- All kneel at the appropriate time during the _Gospel_.
- When the _Gospel_ is finished, an [[Acolyte]] mutes the [[Hockey Puck Mic]] and returns it to the [[Credence Table]].

### Solemn Intercessions
- [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Missal]] for the _Solemn Intercessions_, which the [[Priest]] reads at his seat, and another friar reads from the Gospel side lectern.
- All [[Altar Server|Servers]], except the [[Book Bearer]], kneel/stand at _Let us kneel_/_Let us stand_. [[Book Bearer]] steps back at these times to allow the [[Priest]] and [[Deacon]] to kneel, then steps forward again when they stand.

### Adoration of the Holy Cross
Immediately following the [[#Solemn Intercessions]]:

- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]]:
	- **Take off shoes**, leaving them in the [[Choir Stalls]].
	- Go to the [[Sacristy]] with [[Minister|Ministers]] by way of the [[Passageway]], making a [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] along the way.
	- Light and carry the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]].
- All other [[Altar Server|Servers]]:
	- Remain in [[Choir Stalls#Low]] and **remove shoes**. Leave shoes in [[Choir Stalls]].

#### Procession
[[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank [[Veneration Crucifix]] with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]].

- Order:
	- Cantors.
	- [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1, [[Processional Crucifix]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 2.
	- Attending friar.
- Route: Three stops. At each, _Behold the wood of the cross_ / **Come let us adore him**.
	1. Process from [[Lourde's Door]] to foot of the [[Friars' Chapel]].
	2. Process to the middle of the [[Sanctuary]], centered between the [[Choir Stalls]] on the black strip of flooring near the West edge of the [[Choir Stalls]].
	3. Process into the [[Presbytery]] and stop just after the top step, on the floor of the [[Presbytery]].
- At each stop, the [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]]:
	- Leave room on either side of the [[Veneration Crucifix]] for the attending friar to partially unveil it.
	- Turn inward and face the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- [[Priest]] stands on the steps of the [[Presbytery]] holding the [[Veneration Crucifix]]. [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank him, turned inward, with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]], where they stand for the duration of the [[#Friars' Veneration]].

#### Friars' Veneration
Friars venerate the [[Veneration Crucifix]] in pairs, making three [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] along the way. All [[Altar Server|Servers]] other than [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] standby, seated in the [[Choir Stalls]].

- First pair[^pairs] of friars start in [[Sanctuary]] close to the people, and [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] together, facing the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- First pair moves to middle of [[Sanctuary]], second pair fills in their place. All pairs of friars time their genuflection and movement together.
- First moves to the [[Veneration Crucifix]], second pair fills in first pair's place, third pair fills in second pair's place. All three pairs make [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] together, the first pair kissing the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- First pair turns outward and files back to the [[Choir Stalls]], fourth pair moves in.

[^pairs]: TODO My notes from 2023 say this is done is pairs, but in 2024 they did it single file.

#### Peoples' Veneration
Begins after the last friar has venerated the [[Veneration Crucifix]].

- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank [[Veneration Crucifix]] with [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] as [[Priest]] processes with it, down to the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] place the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] to either side of the [[Veneration Crucifix]], on the [[Sanctuary]] step the crucifix is resting on. Leave plenty of space for a person to stand on either side.
- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] 1 and 2 follow closely behind with purificators, handing them to the [[Priest]] and [[Deacon]].
- [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] follows closely behind and stands in the main aisle, preventing the people from venerating.
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] venerate in a pair simultaneously, followed by the [[Acolyte|Acolytes]], who do the same. This is to demonstrate to the people how to do it.
- All [[Altar Server|Servers]] direct traffic:
	- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] stand on either side of the front of the main aisle, directing the pairs in front of the two lines to venerate simultaneously.
	- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] direct the people on the sides of the church. The people in the [[Rosary Altar]] pews, [[Friars' Chapel]] pews, and North-facing pews go first. Then the people in the side pews go by way of the center pews.
	- [[Master of Ceremonies]] prevents the people in the main pews from venerating until the people in the [[Rosary Altar]] pews, [[Friars' Chapel]] pews, and North-facing pews go. Then he directs traffic, ushering the people out of the pews.
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] venerates the [[Veneration Crucifix]] when the last of the people have venerated.
- An [[Acolyte]] retrieves the bracket and sets it on the center tile in front of the [[Crossing Altar]]. The [[Priest]] places the [[Veneration Crucifix]] in it, and the [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] set the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] on either side of it. They remain there for the rest of the day.
- All return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]] and don shoes.

### Communion
- A [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] lights the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] in the niche, getting fire from the red sconce at the [[Rosary Altar]], [[Genuflection|Genuflecting]] when approaching to get fire. Then he returns to the [[Choir Stalls|Choir Stall]].
- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] 1 and 2 start setting the [[Crossing Altar]]:
	- Spread the altar cloth.
	- Place the [[Missal]], with [[Missal Stand]] on the [[Altar]].
	- Place the [[Hockey Puck Mic]] just in front of the [[Missal Stand]] and unmute it.
	- Bring the [[Burse]] and spread the [[Corporal|Corporals]] on the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]]. Return the [[Burse]] to the [[Credence Table]].
	- Return to [[Choir Stalls]].
- When the [[Deacon]] is ready:
	- [[Master of Ceremonies]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] precede [[Deacon]] to the Altar of Repose ([[Rosary Altar]]). [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] take up the lit [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] from the niche along the way, [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] takes up the [[Humeral Veil]].
	- Form up and [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] with the [[Deacon]].
	- [[Master of Ceremonies]] assists [[Deacon]] with the [[Humeral Veil]], then [[Genuflection|Genuflects]] and returns to the [[Sanctuary]].
	- When the [[Deacon]] has the Eucharist and turns, [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] precede him to the [[Crossing Altar]]:
		- Upon approaching the [[Crossing Altar]], stand on either side of it and face inward.
		- When the Eucharist is placed on the [[Corporal]], place candles on the [[Crossing Altar]], move to the front of the [[Crossing Altar]] approaching from either side, [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] together, and return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]].
	- [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] extinguishes the [[Rosary Altar]] sanctuary lamp, and assists [[Deacon]] and other [[Priest|Priests]] with [[Humeral Veil]] as needed.
	- Meanwhile, [[Priest|Priests]] retrieve more Eucharist from the [[Sacristy]].
- All return to [[Choir Stalls#Low]].
- After the [[Priest]] receives communion, receive communion in two lines, letting the friars receive first. No bell is run nor [[Crotalus]] clapped.
- After communion, a [[Minister]] takes the Eucharist to the back of the [[Tabernacle]] in the [[Sacristy]].
- At that point:
	- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] take the [[Burse]] to the [[Crossing Altar]], fold up and put away the [[Corporal]], and then put them back on the [[Credence Table]].
	- An [[Acolyte]] mutes the [[Hockey Puck Mic]] and returns it to the [[Credence Table]].
	- [[Book Bearer]] takes the [[Missal]] and [[Missal Stand|Stand]] back to the [[Choir Stalls]].
	- **The altar cloth and candles are left on the [[Altar]]**.
