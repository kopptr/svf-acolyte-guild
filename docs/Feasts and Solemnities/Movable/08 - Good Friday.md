	2. Process to the middle of the [[Sanctuary]].
	3. Process into the [[Presbytery]] and to the foot of the [[High Altar]].

#### Friars' Veneration
Friars venerate the [[Veneration Crucifix]] in pairs, making three [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] along the way. All [[Altar Server|Servers]] other than [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] standby, seated in the [[Choir Stalls]].

- First pair of friars start in [[Sanctuary]] close to the people, and [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] together, facing the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- First pair moves to middle of [[Sanctuary]], second pair fills in their place. All pairs of friars time their genuflection and movement together.
- First moves to the [[Veneration Crucifix]], second pair fills in first pair's place, third pair fills in second pair's place. All three pairs make [[Genuflection#Solemn Genuflection]] together, the first pair kissing the [[Veneration Crucifix]].
- First pair turns outward and files back to the [[Choir Stalls]], fourth pair moves in.

#### Peoples' Veneration

- When everyone is finished, [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] reverence, and then immediately go to [[Credence Table]] to retrieve pillows and veil.
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] come and reverence.
- When [[Altar Server|Servers]] are done reverencing, [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] arrange the pillows and veil
