# Epiphany
_The Epiphany of the Lord_.

Traditionally Epiphany is celebrated on January 6th, however, in the [[Archdiocese of New York]], it is celebrated on the first Sunday after [[01-01 - Mary, Mother of God|Mary, Mother of God]].
It is a [[Preservation of Dominican Customs|Dominican Custom]] to chant a [[Sequence]] before the [[Alleluia]][^ordo_sequence]. At our [[Parish of St. Vincent Ferrer and St. Catherine of Siena|Parish]] we forgo this during the principal [[Roman Rite]] Mass, reserving it for the celebration of Epiphany in the [[Dominican Rite]].

## Overview

- The [[#Three Kings Procession]] includes the [[Schola Cantorum]] and two stations: one at the [[Rosary Altar]] and the other at the [[Holy Name Chapel]].
- Proclamation of the year's movable feasts.
- For this great [[Solemnity]], two additional [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]] (four total) may be used for the [[Eucharistic Prayer]].

### Three Kings Procession
Mass is preceded by a Solemn Procession of the Three Kings Figurines to the manger scene.

- Formation:
	- [[Thurifer]]
	- [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1, [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 2
	- [[Lucifer]] 3, [[Lucifer]] 4, starting empty-handed. Unless [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]] would like to, these [[Altar Server|Altar Servers]] carry figurines between the first and second station.
	- [[Schola Cantorum]]
	- [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]]
	- [[Celebrant]]
- Route:
	- North out the [[Lourde's Door]].
	- Turn left and head West down the center aisle. Do not stop to reverence at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].
	- Turn right and head North toward the [[St. Patrick Chapel]].
	- Turn right and head North toward the [[Rosary Altar]].
- First station at the [[Rosary Altar]]:
	- Halt outside the [[Rosary Altar]]:
		- [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]], and [[Guidelines for the Worship of the Eucharist Outside of Mass]] form up in front of the first station of the cross, facing South.
		- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] 3 and 4 stand outside the [[Rosary Altar]] to the right of the gate, waiting to receive figurines.
	- Standby while the first responsory is said.
	- Standby for the proclamation of the movable feasts.
- Route (continued):
	- Form up and head South toward the [[Lourde's Door]]. Do not stop to reverence when crossing in front of the [[Sanctuary]].
	- Turn right and head down the Southern aisle toward the [[Holy Name Chapel]].
	- Turn left and enter the [[Holy Name Chapel]].
- Second station at the [[Holy Name Chapel]]:
	- Form up in a line facing East inside the chapel. [[Schola Cantorum]] waits outside of the chapel, and rejoins the formation after the station.
	- [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]], and [[Thurifer]] standby.
	- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] deposit figurines.
	- All standby while the second responsory is said.
- Route (continued):
	- Form up and head North out of the [[Holy Name Chapel]].
	- Turn right and head East up the main aisle, and proceed as usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]]. However, **do not wait for the hymn to end and the Introit to begin**. Instead immediately [[Reverence]] and enter the [[Sanctuary]]. This is to account for the larger number in the procession.

### Order of Mass
The remainder is as usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:
- All four [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] plant [[Torch|Torches]] during the [[Eucharistic Prayer]].
- The [[Schola Cantorum]] sings and additional hymn during the [[Ablutions]].
- A Christological hymn is sung in lieu of a Marian hymn after the _Dismissal_.
