[^figurines]: #liturgy-todo for years after 2024: Schedule 3 extra servers to carry the figurines, and have two of them hold additional torches during the consecration.

### Order of Mass
The remainder is as usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:

- A Sequence may precede the [[Alleluia]]. If it does, wait for the [[Alleluia]] to start before starting the Gospel Procession.
