	- Servers and Priests head to [[Saint Catherine of Siena Church|SCS]] when setup at [[Saint Vincent Ferrer Church|SVF]] is complete, being sure to get there in plenty of time to set up for the portion at [[Saint Catherine of Siena Church|SCS]] and start on time.
		- Servers carry their surplices (rather than wear them) so they don't get dirty.
		- Bring [[Processional Crucifix]] and [[Torch]]es.

## Sext
- Process from Sacristy out the side, and into the Sanctuary from the front. Use the short, direct route across the front of the church. Order:
	1. [[Boat Bearer]], [[Thurifer]]
	2. [[Lucifer]] 3, [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer]] 4.
	3. [[Acolyte]] 1, [[Acolyte]] 2, empty-handed.
	4. Any extra servers, empty-handed.
- [[Lucifer]] 3, [[Crucifer]], and [[Lucifer]] 4 sit at the [[Sedilia]]. Other servers sit in choir on the Epistle side. Servers can rest the [[Torch]]es / [[Processional Crucifix]] on the ground when appropriate.
- Stand and sit at appropriate times with congregation. Follow the pamphlet.
- When Sext is finished, servers retrieve needed items and start procession.

## Solemn Procession
The First Form of the Procession is used.
Order:

1. [[Thurifer]], [[Boat Bearer]] just behind him and to his left.
2. [[Lucifer]] 3 , [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer]] 4
3. [[Book Bearer]] with the Prayers of the Faithful, Holy Water bearer empty-handed.
4. Extra servers empty-handed.

Process out of the Sanctuary down the middle aisle to the back of the church, where there is a lectern. No incense is imposed before this procession.

Form up:

- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] split to the right and form up facing the middle.
- [[Lucifer]] 3, [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer]] 4 split to the left and form up facing the middle.
- [[Book Bearer]], Holy Water Bearer, and any extra servers split to the left and form up behind the [[Processional Crucifix]] facing the middle.

### Blessing of Palms
- When Priest finishes the introduction and text of the blessing of palms, Holy Water Bearer attends to the priest while he sprinkles Holy Water, following him and holding the [[Aspersorium]] and his cope on his right side.
- When finished, Holy Water Bearer sets down [[Aspersorium]] in its place, grabs enough palms for himself, the [[Book Bearer]], and any extra servers, and returns to formation.

### Gospel, (Homily)
- If using incense for the Gospel (in 2023 we didn't do this, but it was likely by accident):
	- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] approach Deacon to charge incense, or [[Boat Bearer]] gives boat to [[Thurifer]] if there is not enough space.
	- After Deacon's blessing, [[Thurifer]] leads Deacon to the lectern, [[Lucifer]]s 3 and 4 approach the lectern and flank it, and Holy Water Bearer gives Priest a palm.
	- [[Thurifer]] attends to Deacon for the _Gospel_. 
	- After _Gospel_, [[Thurifer]] and [[Lucifer]]s return to formation.
	- Someone gives Deacon a Palm.
- If not using incense, everyone stands in formation.
- Priest may optionally preach a homily.

### Universal Prayer
[[Book Bearer]] approaches Priest, then Deacon, then priest again holding the Prayers of the Faithful. When finished, he sets the Prayers of the Faithful on a table in the back and returns to formation.

### Procession Proper
- Cue: Priest intones _Let us proceed in peace_.
- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] approach Priest to impose incense, or [[Boat Bearer]] gives [[Incense Boat]] to [[Thurifer]] if there is not enough space.
- Any servers not carrying anything should take a palm for the procession.
- After that, all form up and leave when the [[Schola Cantorum]] starts to sing. Exit through the main entrance.

Order:
1. [[Thurifer]] in the center, [[Boat bearer]] just behind and to the left.
2. [[Lucifer]] 3, [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer]] 4
3. [[Acolyte]]s 1 and 2, both holding Palms.
4. Any extra servers. Number servers determines whether to go in pairs or threes.
5. Choir + quartet
6. Celebrant and Deacon
7. The People

Follow the police's instruction. Expected route:

- Turn right to head West on 68th Street.
- Turn left to head South on 1st Avenue.
- Turn right to head West on 66th Street.
- Turn left to enter [[Saint Vincent Ferrer Church|SVF]] from entrance at corner of 66th Street and Lexington Avenue.
- Wait in [[Narthex]] while procession catches up.
- Cue: Schola starts the first Introit.
- Turn left to enter the main church, and go straight up the center aisle.
- Stop at the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]].

During the Procession, the [[Boat Bearer]] should assist the [[Thurifer]] in adding more incense as needed. The Ignifer should relight the torches inside the [[Narthex]] while waiting for the procession to catch up.

## Order of Mass

### Entrance
After the Introit, there is a sung _Kyrie_ in place of the Penitential Rite.

- Wait for introit, then enter [[Sanctuary]].
	- Alternately - don't. There are a lot of people that need to enter the [[Sanctuary]] so it's it might be better to go in right away so we don't run out of music. Check with James.
- [[Thurifer]] and [[Boat Bearer]] assist with incensation of the [[Crossing Altar]] as usual.
	- [[Boat Bearer]] may switch to using [[Saint Vincent Ferrer Church|SVF]]'s boat at any time after entering [[Saint Vincent Ferrer Church|SVF]], including at this point. Switch when the [[Saint Catherine of Siena Church|SCS]] boat is low on incense.
- When done, [[Acolyte]] 1 and [[Crucifer]] assist Priests in taking off [[Cope]]s and donning [[Chasuble]]s. Place [[Cope]]s on the [[Choir Stalls]] on the Epistle side.
- Place any extra Palms in the [[Choir Stalls#Low]].

### Collect
After sung _Kyrie_, [[Book Bearer]] bears the [[Missal]].

### Gospel, Homily, Credo, Offertory, Preface
Servers stand in place, no Gospel procession, and no incense or candles are used. Servers kneel at the appropriate time during the _Gospel_ with the rest of the congregation.

Credo is sung. Universal Prayer is omitted, since it happened as part of the Solemn Procession.

Offertory and Preface as normal.

### Sanctus through Great Amen
At _Sanctus_, six servers line up at the foot of the altar, from left to right:

- [[Lucifer]] 3 with [[Processional Candle]]
- [[Lucifer]] 2 with [[Torch]]
- [[Boat Bearer]]
- [[Thurifer]]
- [[Lucifer]] 1 with [[Torch]] Candle. 
- [[Lucifer]] 4 with [[Processional Candle]].

[[Thurifer]] is in the middle, [[Lucifer]]s are spaced evenly, [[Boat Bearer]] is to the [[Thurifer]]'s left and is the only one who is asymmetrical. 

[[Boat Bearer]] assists [[Thurifer]] in imposing more incense shortly before the [[Epiclesis]]. Cue: Priest starts listing saints' names ([[Eucharistic Prayer#I]]). If a different [[Eucharistic Prayer]] is used, add incense shortly after kneeling.

### Recession
- As normal, with extra servers lined up in pairs and holding palms.
- Depart in silence; no Marian Antiphon.

## Cleanup
As normal, except:

- [[Saint Catherine of Siena Church|SCS]]'s [[Thurible]] and [[Incense Boat]] remain at [[Saint Vincent Ferrer Church|SVF]], since it is needed for [[Holy Thursday]].
