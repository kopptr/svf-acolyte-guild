## Order of Mass

### Procession through Dismissal
As usual, except:

- [[Thurifer]] adds extra charcoal during the Ablutions.

### Recession
- _Holy God we Praise They Name_ is sung instead of a Marian hymn.
- [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] form up at the foot of the altar as usual.
- [[Thurifer]] charges the [[Thurible]], in order to "smoke out the church with as much incense as possible"[^email]. Then he lines up in the main aisle, West of the [[Crucifer]][^alternate_formation].
- Everyone stands there for the duration of the hymn.

[^email]: According to a 2023 email from Fr. Reginald.
[^alternate_formation]: In 2023, the Thurifer lined up with the [[Celebrant]] and [[Deacon]] across the front of the [[Sanctuary]], outside the [[Deacon]].
