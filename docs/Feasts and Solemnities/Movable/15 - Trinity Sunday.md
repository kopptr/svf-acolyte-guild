### Recession
- _Holy God we Praise They Name_ is sung instead of a Marian hymn.
- [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer]]s form up at the foot of the altar as usual.
- [[Celebrant]], two [[Deacon]]s, and [[Thurifer]] (with [[Thurible]] and [[Incense Boat]]) form up in a line across the front of the [[Sanctuary]].
- [[Thurifer]] assists with charging the incense, in order to "smoke out the church with as much incense as possible"[^email].
- Everyone stands there for the duration of the hymn.
- [[Thurifer]] retrieves the [[Thurible]], moves to the front of the formation, and leads the Recession out the usual route.
