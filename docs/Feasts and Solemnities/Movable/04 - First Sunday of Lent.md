# The First Sunday of Lent
The _Rite of Sending of Catechumens_ is allowed for the first Sunday of [[Lent]], though we omit it[^catechumens]. Traditionally, our [[Parish of St. Vincent Ferrer and St. Catherine of Siena|Parish]] does a [[#Litany of the Saints Procession]] on this Sunday.

[^catechumens]: If ever we wanted to reintroduce this rite, it would occur immediately following the _Homily_, and the [[Credo]] and [[Universal Prayer]] would be omitted.

## Overview
[[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]] during [[Lent]] with:

- Shortened [[#Entrance]].
- Addition [[#Special Collect]].
- [[#Litany of the Saints Procession]].
- _Penitential Rite_ omitted.

## Preparation
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:

- [ ] [[Chasuble]] for [[Celebrant]] near his seat.

## Order of Mass

### Entrance
Use [[Procession#Short Cloister Walk Procession to Crossing Altar]], do **not** wait for music change to enter the [[Sanctuary]].

### Reverence to the Altar
- The [[Celebrant]] reverences the [[Altar]].
- Assisted by the [[Thurifer]] (and [[Deacon]], if present), the [[Celebrant]] incenses the [[Altar]] as at [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Reverence to the Altar]].

## Special Collect
The _Penitential Rite_ is omitted. Immediately following the [[#Reverence to the Altar]], the [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Missal]] for the [[Celebrant]]. When finished, he returns to his seat and deposits the [[Missal]].

### Litany of the Saints Procession
Immediately following the [[#Special Collect]], the [[Procession]] starts:

- [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] retrieve their [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]], [[Thurifer]] [[Imposition of Incense#At the Stand]], and [[Crucifer]] retrieves the [[Processional Crucifix]].
- The [[Thurifer]] leads the procession out of the [[Sanctuary]] and down the main aisle, **not** stopping to reverence at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].
- **Order**:
	- [[Thurifer]]
	- [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1, [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 2
	- [[Schola Cantorum]]
	- [[Minister|Ministers]]
- **Route**:
	- Pass [[Crossing Altar]] on right side and exit the [[Sanctuary]].
	- Head West down the center aisle.
	- Turn left and head South toward [[Holy Name Chapel]].
	- Turn left and head East up the 65th Street aisle.
	- Turn left and head North across the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].
		- **Do not stop** to reverence at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].
	- Turn left and head West down the 66th Street aisle.
	- Turn left and head South toward the main aisle.
	- Turn left and head East up the main aisle.
	- Stop at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].
	- Wait until the _Saint X_ / **Pray for us** portion is finished. **Cue**: _Lord be merciful_ / **Lord save your people**.
	- Enter the [[Sanctuary]], not stopping to reverence the [[Tabernacle]] and passing the [[Crossing Altar]] on the right side.
	- All return their items and go to their places. The [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] assists the [[Celebrant]] in changing into his [[Chasuble]] as the litany concludes.
	- All standby until the litany is finished.
- **Pace**: The _Litany of the Saints_ is very long, and so the pace should be very slow. The [[Thurifer]] would do well to memorize the names of saints around the quarter marks to help him set the pace correctly.

### Kyrie
A brief sung [[Kyrie]] will immediately follow the [[#Litany of the Saints Procession]]. All standby.

### Collect
The usual [[Collect]] follows immediately after the [[Kyrie]] that ends the [[#Litany of the Saints Procession]]. The [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Missal]].

### First Reading through Recession
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]].
