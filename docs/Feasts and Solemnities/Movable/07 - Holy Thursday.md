## Order of Mass

### Procession, Introit
As normal for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:

- The [[Altar Server|Servers]] are followed by three RCIA students carrying the Holy Oils, then the [[Schola Cantorum]], then the [[Minister|Ministers]].
- Do not stop to wait for the [[Introit]] to begin.
- [[Inclination#Major Inclination]] rather than [[Genuflection#Standard Genuflection]] upon entering the [[Sanctuary]], since the Eucharist is not present.
- The [[Celebrant]] will receive the Holy Oils from the laity and place them on a small table in front of the [[Crossing Altar]].
- The [[Celebrant]] incenses the [[Crossing Altar]] with the aid of the [[Thurifer]] / [[Boat Bearer]] as usual. He also incenses the Holy Oils.

### Reception of the Holy Oils
- [[Celebrant]] reads an explanation at his chair (no book needed).
- After the explanation, the [[Master of Ceremonies]] oversees transfer of the Holy Oils:
	- [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]] take Holy Oils to the [[Ambry]] and return to their seats.
	- [[Oil Bearer]] takes the table the Holy Oils were on and places it next to the [[Credence Table]].

### Penitential Rite
As normal.

### Gloria
As many servers as we have [[Hand Bells]] ring [[Hand Bells]] during the _Gloria_:

- When ringing, do so continuously, it is fine to ring while sitting and while standing, mirror the posture of the [[Celebrant]].
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] should help cue the [[Altar Server|Servers]] for bell ringing.
- Start ringing:
	- **Cue**: End of _Gloria in excelsis Deo_, and [[Schola Cantorum]] starts singing.
- Stop ringing:
	- **Cue**: End of _et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis_. Also, the back organ will come in very loudly.
- Silence until the next cue.
- Start ringing:
	- **Cue**: End of _Quoniam tu solus Sanctus_, again, the back organ will come in very loudly.
- Continue Ringing bells all the way through the end of the _Gloria_, through the end of the _Amen_ at the end of it, then stop.

**This is the last use of a bell in the church until the _Gloria_ of the [[09 - Easter Vigil|Easter Vigil]]**.

	- All other [[Altar Server|Servers]] in pairs.
	- The rest

### Cleanup
**Observe absolute silence**. Remove surplices. Take all candles and altar cloths in the church (**except for the [[Rosary Altar]]**), and place them in the [[Cloister Walk]], labeling each with an index card. Roughly in order:

- Extinguish [[Crossing Altar]] candles, [[Sanctuary#Polychrome Candles]], [[High Altar#Candles]].
- Normal Mass cleanup.
- Remove altar cloths, altar crucifix, and candles.
	- **The linen on top of the [[Crossing Altar]] gets rolled up, not folded.**
- Extinguish and remove every candle, altar cloth, and unveiled cross, crucifix, or statue in the entire church. Don't forget:
	- Side altars/chapels.
	- Rood screen candles
	- Votive candles
- Unveil pulpit and high altar crosses.
