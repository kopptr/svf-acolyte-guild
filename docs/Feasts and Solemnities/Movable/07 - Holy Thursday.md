## Order of Mass

### Procession
- Normal route / order
- [[Inclination#Major Inclination]] rather than [[Genuflection#Standard Genuflection]] upon entering the [[Sanctuary]], since the Eucharist is not present.
- Some laity will process with us bearing the Holy Oils. The Celebrant will receive the oils and place them on a small table in front of the [[Crossing Altar]].
- The priest incenses the [[Crossing Altar]] with the aid of the [[Thurifer]] / [[Boat Bearer]] as usual. He also incenses the Holy Oils.

### Introit
As normal.

### Reception of the Holy Oils
- Celebrant reads an explanation at his chair. (No book needed).
- After explanation, [[Master of Ceremonies]] oversees transfer of the Holy Oils:
	- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] 1, 2, and 3, take Holy Oils to the [[Ambry]] and return to their seats.
	- [[Lucifer]] 4 takes the Table into the [[Friars' Chapel]], and returns to his seat.

### Penitential Rite
As normal.

### Gloria
As many servers as we have [[Hand Bells]] ring [[Hand Bells]] during the _Gloria_:
- When ringing, do so continuously, it is fine to ring while sitting an while standing, mirror the posture of the Celebrant.
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] should help cue the servers for bell ringing.
- Start ringing after [[Schola Cantorum]] comes in after intonation ("Gloria in excelsis Deo").
- Stop ringing after the next line, "et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis". Other cue is that the back organ will come in very loudly.
- Silence until the next cue.
- Start ringing again at "Quoniam tu solus Sanctus", again, the back organ will come in very loudly as a cue.
- Ring bells all the way through the end of the _Gloria_, through the end of the _Amen_ at the end of it.

### Collect, Reading, Gradual, Reading
As normal.

### Tract, Gospel, Homily
As normal, including usual procession with [[Processional Candle]]s and [[Thurifer]].

### Washing of Feet
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] and [[Book Bearer]] help priest change: remove his [[Chasuble]] and drape it on the [[Choir Stalls]] nearby, then help the priest don the Apron.
- Other servers arrange the 12 seats for those whose feet is to be washed:
	- Arranged on the top step of the [[Sanctuary]], facing out, in three sections, North, West, and South.
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] helps guide people to their seats.
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] and [[Book Bearer]] bring the Basin and Ewer to the Celebrant, towels to the  Deacon.
- During the washing:
	- [[Master of Ceremonies]] moves basin.
	- [[Book Bearer]] assists with Ewer and towels as needed.
- After the washing:
	- [[Acolyte]] 1 takes the Basin and Ewer, [[Acolyte]] 3 takes the towels.
	- All form up and reverence the [[Crossing Altar]], then enter the [[Sanctuary]].
	- [[Acolyte]]s 1 and 3 return the Basin, Ewer, and towels, then [[Lavabo]] the priest at his seat.
		- #todo Does this Lavabo happen or is it just a blue/green book thing? CotLY#204, Ceremonial of Bishops#302, which it claims applies to priests.
	- [[Acolyte]] 2 helps the Celebrant remove his Apron, stows it, retrieves the [[Chasuble]], and helps Celebrant don it after the [[Lavabo]].
	- [[Master of Ceremonies]] helps those who had their feet washed return to their place.
	- Other servers put the chairs away, at the direction of the [[Master of Ceremonies]].

### Universal Prayer, Offertory, Preface
No Creed(?). Otherwise all as usual.

### Sanctus
Six servers process to front of [[Crossing Altar]], just like [[06 - Palm Sunday|Palm Sunday]] (TODO refactor this into a separate rubric).

### Eucharistic Prayer
- If [[Eucharistic Prayer#I]] is used, N.B. there are variations of the usual words.
- [[Crotalus]] Clapper uses [[Crotalus]] instead of hand bells, only at the elevations, **not at the epiclesis**.

### Procession of the Blessed Sacrament
- Form up:

- Procession:
	- [[Lucifer]] 3, [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer]] 4 turn and lead the procession.
		- [[Crucifer]] sets a **VERY** slow pace. He should look at the pamphlet before Mass in an attempt to set pace to the amount of music.

		- Cue to start: Celebrant turns from the [[Crossing Altar]] and starts walking.
