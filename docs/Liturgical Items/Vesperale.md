The _Vesperale_ is the cloth that covers the [[High Altar]] when [[Mass]] is not being said at it. It serves to:

- Protect the [[Altar cloth]] from damage due to falling wax / embers
- Prevent dust build-up on the [[Altar cloth]].

Consequently, when serving a [[Mass]] at the [[High Altar]]:

- Remove the Vesperale **after** lighting the [[High Altar#Candles]].
- Replace the Vesperale **before** snuffing the [[High Altar#Candles]].
