- [ ] [[Rosary Altar]]:
	- [ ] Four altar candles lit.
	- [ ] Gate open, cushion set aside.
- [ ] Remind [[Celebrant]] he needs the lapel mic.

## Conduct
- If there is a Cantor and the Congregation is not singing the Mass parts (very common for weddings), sing the Mass parts in a very quiet voice (or just mouth them) so as not to interfere with the vocalist.

## Order of Mass
As [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], with changes outlined in the following subsections.

### Procession
[[Procession#Passageway Procession to Crossing Altar]], except:

- The groomsmen will process between the [[Altar Server|Servers]] and the [[Minister|Ministers]]. The groom is a [[Minister]] and processes last.
- Bridesmaids and bride join the [[Procession]] at the main aisle.
- The [[Altar Server|Servers]] should stop short of the kneeler, and reverence with the kneeler between them and the [[Sanctuary]].
- The [[Thurifer]] should not wait for an entrance antiphon, he should reverence and break formation immediately.

### Officium through Homily
- [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Ritual]] for the [[Celebrant]] at his seat immediately after the first incensation for the opening prayers.
- The _Penitential Act_ is omitted.
- The _Gloria_ is sung.

### Rite of Marriage
If no [[Wedding Crucifix]] is used, the [[Wedding Crucifix Bearer]]'s actions are omitted and only the [[Holy Water Bearer]] leaves the [[Sanctuary]].

After the _Homily_, the [[Celebrant]] will likely return to his seat for a moment. When he rises and moves to the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]]:

- [[Holy Water Bearer]] and [[Wedding Crucifix Bearer]] retrieve the [[Aspersorium]] and [[Wedding Crucifix]], and move to the foot of the [[Sanctuary]]. Their place is lined up in a pair facing South, backs to the pews in front of the [[Rosary Altar]].
- Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] standby in [[Choir Stalls]], sitting and standing with the Congregation.

#### Questions & Consent
**Cue**: _Since it is your intention_:

- [[Wedding Crucifix Bearer]] brings the [[Wedding Crucifix]] to the couple, hands it to them, and returns to his place, all without making a reverence.

#### Blessing & Exchange of Rings
**Cue**: _Let us bless the Lord_ **Thanks be to God**:

- [[Wedding Crucifix Bearer]] and [[Holy Water Bearer]] approach in a pair. [[Holy Water Bearer]] with [[Aspersorium]]. No reverence.
- [[Wedding Crucifix Bearer]] receives the [[Wedding Crucifix]], and returns to his place immediately making no reverence. [[Holy Water Bearer]] stands by.
- The [[Celebrant]] blesses the rings and sprinkles them. When he returns the [[Aspergillium]], [[Holy Water Bearer]] returns to his place immediately, making no reverence.

[[Wedding Crucifix Bearer]] and [[Holy Water Bearer]] standby in place outside of [[Sanctuary]] until the [[Celebrant]] returns to the [[Sanctuary]]. This will likely be after the _Universal Prayer_, but could happen before it.

### Universal Prayer
The _Credo_ is omitted.

### Offertory
- There will be an extra [[Personal Chalice]] from which the Bride and Groom will receive the Precious Blood. This must be brought to the [[Altar]] after the [[Missal]] and [[Chalice Stack]].
- The [[Thurifer]] incenses the Bride and Groom after the [[Celebrant]] (and [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]]) and before the People. He:
	- Descends to the bottom step of the [[Sanctuary]] on the Northwest corner. He may need to instruct the couple to rise. Then he incenses them from that spot.
	- Ascends to the platform in front of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] (from where he would normally incense the people), and incenses the people. Again, he may need to signal that they should stand.

### Preface
As usual.

### Sanctus through Great Amen
As normal for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except the formation is different:

```
       AAA
To Be __ __ Th To 
__ __ __ __ __ __ 
__ __ Br Gr __ __ 
```

- The bride (`Br`) and groom (`Gr`) kneel at their kneeler in the middle (outside the [[Sanctuary]]), facing the [[Crossing Altar]] (`AAA`).
- The [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]] (`To`) kneel on the outside-most tiles on the _top_step_[^top_step], and plant the [[Torch|Torches]] on the top step.
- The [[Bell Ringer]] (`Be`) brings the [[Hand Bells]]. He and the [[Thurifer]] (`Th`) kneel on the top step, on the tiles inside and adjacent to the [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]]' tiles. The [[Thurifer]] is on the groom's side.
- The [[Bell Ringer]] rings the [[Hand Bells]] from this formation. He should take care that they do not ring when entering / leaving this formation.
- When entering this formation as the _Sanctus_ starts, [[Altar Server|Servers]]:
	- Get their items and leave the [[Sanctuary]] in pairs, [[Torch|Torches]] second. They will descend the steps to the North of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]], and then walk around the steps.
	- They fall into formation standing West of the couple (i.e. behind them), but lined up (North-South-wise) with the places in which they will kneel. One [[Lucifer|Torch bearer]] and the [[Thurifer]] must walk _behind_ the couple to do this.
	- As the _Sanctus_ ends, they move East to ascend the steps and kneel in their places.
- When leaving this formation at the _Great Amen_, [[Altar Server|Servers]]:
	- Stand, turn inward, descend, walk to place where they lined up during _Sanctus_, and turn inward again to face the [[Altar]].
	- [[Genuflection|Genuflect]].
	- [[Thurifer]] and South [[Lucifer|Torch bearer]] walk _behind_ the couple, all four [[Altar Server|Servers]] form up in pairs ([[Lucifer|Torch bearers]] second), and return to the [[Sanctuary]] by way of the steps North of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]].

[^top_step]: Let's see how this looks and reevaluate. I think it's worth trying having the torches on the bottom step and the Thurifer / Bell ringer on the top. #liturgy-todo 

### Communion

#### Our Father
After the _Our Father_, the _Nuptial Blessing_ takes the place of the "Deliver us" prayer, and the [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Ritual]] for it:

- **Cue**: _Our Father_ ends, [[Celebrant]] starts to leave the [[Sanctuary]]
- [[Book Bearer]] meets the [[Celebrant]] at the couple's place and holds the [[Ritual]] for the him as he gives the _Nuptial Blessing_.
	- [[Book Bearer]] should follow along **so he can turn the pages for the celebrant**.
- When finished, he returns the [[Ritual]] and goes back to his seat.

#### Agnus Dei through Priest's Communion
As usual.

#### Couple's Communion
The Bride and Groom receive the Host first. The [[Celebrant]] returns and the couple receive from the extra [[Chalice]]. Standby.

#### Servers' Communion
**Cue**: [[Celebrant]] returns to [[Sanctuary]] from distributing the [[Chalice]] to the couple:

- Receive as usual.

#### Peoples' Communion
Standby kneeling at seats.

#### Couple give flowers to Mary
The couple will leave a bouquet at the [[Rosary Altar]]. Standby. The [[#Ablutions]] likely won't start until the couple returns, but pay attention to the [[Celebrant]], and be ready when he needs you.

#### Ablutions
As normal. [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] must remember to take both [[Chalice]]s.

#### Postcommunion Prayer
As usual.

#### Final Blessing and Dismissal
[[Celebrant]] will give the final blessing at the foot of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] in front of the Bride and Groom:

- **Cue**: [[Celebrant]] approaches the couple.
- [[Book Bearer]] meets [[Celebrant]] in front of the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]], takes the [[Ritual]] from him, and holds it while the [[Concelebrant]] reads. He stands by until the [[Celebrant]] returns to reverence the [[Altar]].
- Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] standby.

### Recession
**Cue**: [[Celebrant]] returns from giving the final blessing:

- [[Book Bearer]] returns the [[Ritual]] and then gets the [[Processional Crucifix]].
- Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] retrieve their items and form up near their [[Choir Stalls]], stand by.
- After the [[Celebrant]] has reverenced the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] and the wedding party has recessed.
- Form up at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]] as normal.
- Reverence with the [[Minister|Ministers]].
- [[Crucifer]] leads the procession directly to the [[Lourde's Door]], **not down the main aisle**.

## If there is a Deacon
If there is a [[Deacon]]:

- [[Deacon]] holds the [[Ritual]] for the _Nuptial Blessing_ after the [[#Our Father]] (instead of the [[Book Bearer]]).
- [[Book Bearer]] still holds the [[Ritual]] for the [[#Final Blessing and Dismissal]].

## Adjustments for fewer servers
If there are only three [[Altar Server|Servers]]:

- For [[#Procession]] / [[#Recession]], see: [[Procession#Three servers]].
- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] act as [[Holy Water Bearer]] and [[Wedding Crucifix Bearer]].
- [[Altar Server|Servers]] act as [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]] and [[Thurifer]] at the _Sanctus_.
	- Place [[Hand Bells]] near [[Cantor]] (James)'s spot and ask him to be the [[Bell Ringer]].
	- If there are no non-[[Altar Server|Server]] capable of ringing the [[Hand Bells]], only use [[Thurifer]] and [[Bell Ringer]].

If there are only two [[Altar Server|Servers]]:

- For [[#Procession]] / [[#Recession]], see: [[Procession#Two servers]].
- For [[#Procession]], couple may opt for [[Procession#Short Cloister Walk Procession to Crossing Altar]].
- At _Gospel Procession_, only have a [[Thurifer]], no [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]].
- At _Sanctus_, only have a [[Thurifer]] and [[Bell Ringer]], no [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]]. They still take their places on the top step.

If there is only one [[Altar Server|Server]]:

- For [[#Procession]] / [[#Recession]], see: [[Procession#One server]].
- For [[#Procession]], couple will likely opt for [[Procession#Short Cloister Walk Procession to High Altar]].
- No incense or [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] are used; all [[Thurifer]] / [[Lucifer]] actions are omitted.
- [[Altar Server|Server]] acts as both [[Holy Water Bearer]] and [[Wedding Crucifix Bearer]], holding items in both hands when necessary.
- [[Altar Server|Server]] is [[Bell Ringer]] for the _Eucharistic Prayer_, no incense or [[Torch|Torches]]. [[Bell Ringer]] stays in his seat in the [[Choir Stalls]], rather than moving to the front of the [[Crossing Altar]].
- For [[#Recession]], standby with the [[Celebrant]] at the [[Crossing Altar]], do not retrieve the [[Processional Crucifix]]. At his movement, form up with him in front of the [[Crossing Altar]] and lead him through the [[Lourde's Door]].
