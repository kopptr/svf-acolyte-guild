Procession of the Eucharist in a [[Monstrance]], typically following [[Mass]].

## Transition from Mass

### Peoples' Communion
After receiving Communion:

- The [[High Altar]] is prepared as at [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament]], with the [[Monstrance]] and [[Monstrance Stand]], but no booklets or [[Candelabra|Candelabrae]].

### Ablutions
The Host is exposed in a [[Monstrance]]:

- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] do as at [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Ablutions]].
- [[Thurifer]] 1 adds charcoal to the [[Thurible]] that was used for [[Mass]].
- [[Thurifer]] 2 lights the charcoal of the other [[Thurible]].
- [[Boat Bearer]] dons his fanny pack and switches to the full [[Incense Boat]].
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1 lights the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] with the wind guards, and extinguishes the others.
- Free [[Altar Server|Servers]] help the [[Celebrant]] and [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]] change into [[Cope]]s ([[Deacon|Deacons]] remain in [[Dalmatic]]s).

### Postcommunion Prayer
[[Book Bearer]] holds [[Missal]] as usual. The Dismissal is omitted, so we transition directly into the [[#Eucharistic Exposition]] after the Postcommunion Prayer.

## Eucharistic Exposition
All gather needed items and form up for the [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]] in the [[Sanctuary]]. The [[Master of Ceremonies]] directs traffic, particularly for the [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]] and other Friars. All face the Eucharist. The order of the formation allows a seamless transition to the procession.

### Formation
From furthest from the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] to closest:

1. [[Celebrant]] and [[Deacon|Deacons]]: Centered at the foot of the [[High Altar]].
2. [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]] 1 and 3: kneeling on the first step of the [[High Altar]] centered in the black rectangles.
3. [[Thurifer]] 1 and [[Boat Bearer]]: Behind the Epistle side [[Lucifer|Torch bearer]], waiting to [[Imposition of Incense|Impose Incense]].
4. [[Thurifer]] 2, [[Umbrellino Bearer]], [[Master of Ceremonies]]: Kneeling in [[Presbytery]] off to the Epistle side, in the area between the [[Sedilia]] and the [[Sanctuary#Polychrome Candles|Polychrome Candle]].
5. [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]] and other Friars in choir dress: Will likely stay in their [[Choir Stalls]].
6. [[Crucifer]], flanked by two [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]]: Between [[Choir Stalls#Low]] and [[Ambo]], standing, facing the Eucharist.

### Exposition
- [[Thurifer]] 1 and [[Boat Bearer]] assist with [[Imposition of Incense#Celebrant]].
- [[Thurifer]] 1 and [[Boat Bearer]] join [[Thurifer]] 2, [[Master of Ceremonies]], and [[Umbrellino Bearer]] and kneel.
- After [[Incensation]]:
	- [[Thurifer]] 1 stands, retrieves the [[Thurible]], and returns to position.
	- [[Master of Ceremonies]] helps the [[Celebrant]] don the [[Humeral Veil]].

### Transition to Procession
- When [[Celebrant]] takes the Eucharist, all stand.
- [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] move to center, in the [[Sanctuary]] East of the [[Crossing Altar]].
- When [[Celebrant]] gets to the foot of the [[High Altar]], [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]] converge on [[Celebrant]], forming around him so that each [[Torch]] is the corner of a square, and the [[Celebrant]] is in the middle (or if only two [[Torch|Torches]], in a line).
- [[Umbrellino Bearer]] opens [[Umbrellino]] and follows the [[Eucharist]].
- [[Thurifer]]s and [[Boat Bearer]] precede [[Celebrant]], incensing the Eucharist continually.
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] directs Clergy and those in Choir Dress to file into formation between the [[Processional Crucifix]] and the Eucharist, then he forms up behind the [[Umbrellino Bearer]].
- When the formation is complete, [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] turn and lead the formation down the main aisle and through the route.
- [[Schola Cantorum]] fills in behind when there is room.

## Procession
- Order: see [[Order of Participants in a Eucharistic Procession#Order]].
- Formation is maintained as all Process.
	- [[Crucifer]] sets the pace, communicates with law enforcement to navigate streets, and follows the route.
	- [[Thurifer]]s take turns walking backward to incense the Eucharist. [[Boat Bearer]] assists with charcoal and [[Imposition of Incense]].
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] nominally follows behind the Eucharist formation, but may break formation to direct traffic.
- When the [[Celebrant]] leaves a building:
	- The [[Canopy]] bearers open and bear the [[Canopy]] over the [[Celebrant]].
	- [[Umbrellino Bearer]] closes the [[Umbrellino]] and follows behind.
	- [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]] process **outside of** the [[Canopy]]. If four, one at each corner of the [[Canopy]]. If two, in a horizontal line with the Eucharist at the center, but outside of the [[Canopy]] itself.
- When the [[Celebrant]] enters a building:
	- [[Canopy]] is taken away, and [[Canopy]] bearers remain near the building entrance.
	- [[Umbrellino Bearer]] follows with open [[Umbrellino]].
	- [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]] make as a square (or if two, a line).
	- [[Master of Ceremonies]] may break formation to enter building first ahead of [[Crucifer]] and direct traffic.
 
[^leaving]: These join the procession outdoors upon leaving [[Saint Vincent Ferrer Church|SVF]].

### Stational Altars
If there are any stops to Stational Altars along the way, the details will depend on the particular altar. In general:

- Enter the church in order, and switch from Canopy to [[Umbrellino]].
- Proceed up the main aisle toward the altar.
- Those ahead of the Eucharist in the Procession split to Epistle side, entering or forming up outside of the [[Sanctuary]] as is appropriate.
- [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]]:
	- If a short station (i.e. just [[Benediction]]): split in pairs to either side, and plant the [[Torch|Torches]] for [[Benediction]].
	- For longer stations (i.e. preaching and [[Benediction]]): Stand/sit/kneel with the Congregation on the Epistle side with the other [[Altar Server|Servers]]. When it is time for [[Benediction]], approach the altar with the [[Celebrant]] and kneel for [[Benediction]].
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] assists with [[Humeral Veil]] and directs traffic.
- A [[Thurifer]] and the [[Boat Bearer]] assist with incense at [[Benediction]] when appropriate.
- To leave, everyone forms up and leaves the station, continuing on the route.

### End of Procession
- [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] enter [[Sanctuary]] and stand off to the side, facing in.
- [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]] and Friars file into [[Choir Stalls]] or pews.
- [[Thurifer]] 1, [[Boat Bearer]], [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]] precede/flank the Eucharist to the foot of the [[High Altar]], then enter the formation as at [[#Formation]].
- [[Thurifer]] 2 deposits [[Thurible]] if possible, and files into [[Choir Stalls]].
- [[Umbrellino Bearer]] attends with [[Umbrellino]] until [[Monstrance]] is set down, then closes [[Umbrellino]] and files into [[Choir Stalls]].
- [[Master of Ceremonies]] helps with [[Humeral Veil]], then files into [[Choir Stalls]].

### Exposition
As usual, with [[Thurifer]] 1 and [[Boat Bearer]] as at [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament]].

### End
[[Altar Server|Servers]] exit _in silence_ through [[Sacristy]] or in most dignified and least interruptive way. Items that belong at a different church are taken back.
