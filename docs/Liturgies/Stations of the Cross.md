_Stations of the Cross_ is prayed Fridays during [[Lent]] at 6:45pm, except on [[08 - Good Friday|Good Friday]], when it is prayed at 11:00am.

Those serving this liturgy may proceed to the [[Sacristy]] following Communion at the 6pm Mass to vest.

## Roles
- [[Crucifer]]
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 1
- [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]] 2

## Order
Throughout the whole of the liturgy, the [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] flank the [[Crucifer]], and all three move as a unit. The [[Crucifer]] initiates all movements and turns.

### Entrance
- Ring the [[Entrance Bells]] at the [[Lourde's Door]], process to the foot of the [[Sanctuary]], and [[Reverence]] with the [[Priest]].
- Standby while the [[Priest]] prays the introductory prayers.
- When the [[Priest]] is finished, proceed to the first station.

### For each Station
- Proceed to the painting that corresponds to the station, stopping in front of it.
- Turn to face outward, with backs to the painting.
- Remain standing for the prayers of the station, even as the [[Priest]] and the people kneel and [[Genuflection|Genuflect]].
	- The [[Crucifer]] may rest the [[Processional Crucifix]] on the ground if he must, though it is better to hold it high.
	- The [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] should hold the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]], not setting them down.
- After the station is finished, proceed to the next station.

### The Stations
There are 14 stations, each with a corresponding painting. They are spread throughout the perimeter of the church in order, starting on the North wall near the [[Rosary Altar]], and continuing around the church counterclockwise (when viewed from above).

For the stations whose paintings are against the South wall near the confessionals, the [[Altar Server|Servers]] should form up in the 66th Street aisle with their backs to the pews, lined up with the paintings (instead of in the narrow aisle directly adjacent to the confessionals, with their backs to the paintings). This allows the [[Priest]] and People to follow more easily.

### Conclusion
After the final station:

- Proceed to the foot of the [[Presbytery]].
- Standby while the [[Priest]] prays the closing prayers.
- When he is finished, [[Reverence]] and proceed out the [[Lourde's Door]].
