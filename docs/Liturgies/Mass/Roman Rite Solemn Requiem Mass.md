## Order of Mass
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Order of Mass]], except after the _Postcommunion Prayer_, there is the _Final Commendation and Farewell_.

### Introductory Rites
### Entrance
During the [[Procession]], walk to the left side of the [[Catafalque]].

### Reverence to the Altar through Postcommunion Prayer
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass#Order of Mass]], except:
- [[Thurifer]] adds charcoal after receiving _Communion_.

### Transition
- [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] get their items and process out of the [[Sanctuary]], and stand several paces down the main aisle, facing East.
- [[Thurifer]] (with [[Thurible]] and [[Incense Boat]]) and [[Holy Water Bearer]] (with [[Aspersorium]]), and [[Book Bearer]] (with [[Ritual]]) go to [[Catafalque]] and wait off to the South side, facing North, flush with the main aisle pews.
- [[Celebrant]] joins the [[Thurifer]], [[Holy Water Bearer]], and [[Book Bearer]].

### Final Commendation and Farewell
If the [[Celebrant]] turns to bow to the [[Processional Crucifix]] at any point, [[Altar Server|Servers]] (other than the [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]]) do the same.
- [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Ritual]].
- [[Holy Water Bearer]] assists with [[Aspersorium]], then retrieves it.
- [[Thurifer]] assists with incense, then retrieves it.
- [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Ritual]] (again).

### Recession
- When [[Celebrant]] is finished, all get into position for the Recession:
	- [[Thurifer]] walks past [[Crucifer]] so as to lead the recession
	- [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Candle bearers]] stay in place.
	- [[Holy Water Bearer]] and [[Book Bearer]] in a pair immediately behind [[Crucifer]] (still holding [[Aspersorium]] and [[Ritual]]).
- [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]] will leave the [[Sanctuary]] and join the [[Celebrant]].
- All reverence and turn to recess out as usual.
