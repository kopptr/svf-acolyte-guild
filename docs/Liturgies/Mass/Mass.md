## Rites
At [[Saint Vincent Ferrer Church|SVF]] we celebrate Mass in two Rites: the _Roman Rite_ and the _Dominican Rite_.

### Roman Rite
All Roman Rite Masses are celebrated in the Ordinary Form of the Mass (i.e. the _Novus Ordo_).
- [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]]
- [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]]
- [[Roman Rite Low Mass]]

All Nuptial Masses (i.e. wedding Masses) are also celebrated in the Roman Rite.
- [[Roman Rite Nuptial Mass]]
- [[Roman Rite Nuptial Mass at the High Altar]]

### Dominican Rite
- [[Dominican Rite Low Mass]]
- [[Dominican Rite Solemn High Mass]]

## Designations of Solemnity
The Dominican Rite designates three levels of solemnity for Mass with corresponding rubrics. They are the [[Low Mass]], [[Sung Mass]], and [[Solemn High Mass]]. Although there is no such designation in the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite, we [[Preservation of Dominican Customs|similarly]] make corresponding informal designations for those Masses as well: 
- [[Low Mass]]: 0-1 servers, no Cantor.
- [[Sung Mass]]: 0-1 servers, Cantor.
- [[Solemn High Mass|Solemn Mass]]: 4+ servers, [[Schola Cantorum]].
