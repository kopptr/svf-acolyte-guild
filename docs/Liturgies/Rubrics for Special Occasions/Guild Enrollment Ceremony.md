May take place outside of [[Mass]], but preferably takes place during [[Mass]], after the _Homily_ and before the _Creed_/_Universal Prayer_/_Offertory_.

## Roles
- [[Celebrant]]: Preferably the Pastor.
- [[Master of Ceremonies]]: Recommends the candidates to the [[Celebrant]]. Preferably the [[Guild of St. Stephen|Guild]] Chaplain.
- [[Altar Server|Servers]] to be enrolled.

## Preparation
- [ ] Enrollment register, [[Sacristy]] table.
- [ ] Guild Medals, one per [[Altar Server|Server]] to be enrolled.
- [ ] [[Aspersorium]], near [[Credence Table]].
- [ ] Print-outs of the [[Guild Enrollment Ceremony]], one per [[Altar Server|Server]] to be enrolled and one each for the [[Celebrant]] and [[Master of Ceremonies]]. At each person's seat.

If there are enough vestments, all [[Altar Server|Servers]] to be enrolled vest and sit in choir. If not, then only those serving the [[Mass]] vest, and those not serving [[Mass]] sit in the front pew on the Gospel side.

## Ceremony
During [[Mass]], this immediately follows the _Homily_.

- [[Master of Ceremonies]] calls forward those to be enrolled:
	- _"Let those who are called to the ministry of serving at the Altar please come forward..."_
- All those to be enrolled file from seats into a line across the foot of the [[Sanctuary]], facing the [[Crossing Altar]]. All should have the leaflets with the words of the ceremony.
	- Those who come from the pew simply file out and South across the front of the [[Sanctuary]].
	- Those who come from the [[Sanctuary]] come down the North side of the [[Crossing Altar]] and join at the end of line of those who came from the pews.
	- When all those to be enrolled are in place in the line, those who came from the [[Sanctuary]] [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] while those who came from pews [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]].
- Kneel, stand, and respond as the leaflet directs. When it directs to sit, instead remain standing.
- After the recitation of the [[Guild Promise]], the [[Master of Ceremonies]] brings the [[Aspersorium]] and medals to the [[Celebrant]], who blesses them.
- The [[Celebrant]], attended by the [[Master of Ceremonies]], approaches each man to be enrolled in turn, placing the medal on him and saying the words of enrollment. All stand in their places until everyone is enrolled.
- When finished, the [[Celebrant]] returns to the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]] and gives a blessing.
- At **Amen**, all reverence the [[Crossing Altar|Altar]] and return to their places. Those returning to the [[Sanctuary]] should [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] in their place at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]] before entering. Those seated in pews should [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]].

## After Mass
All those enrolled sign the Guild Register book in the [[Sacristy]].
