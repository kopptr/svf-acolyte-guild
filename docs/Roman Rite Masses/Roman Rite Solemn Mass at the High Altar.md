- [[Thurifer]] retrieves [[Thurible]] and [[Incense Boat]] and joins them.
- All perform the [[Offertory]].
	- The [[Thurifer]] may want to leave the [[Incense Boat]] with the [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] to return to the [[Thurible Stand]] after [[Imposition of Incense|Imposing incense]].

### Preface
Standby, turning to face East when it begins. **Cue**: _Pray Brethren..._.

### Sanctus
- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] and [[Thurifer]] retrieve [[Torch|Torches]] and [[Thurible]].
- [[Thurifer]] adds incense.
- [[Thurifer]] leads, followed by [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]] in a pair. Head East down the center of the [[Sanctuary]], enter [[Presbytery]]. [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]] split. All three stand at foot of [[High Altar]].
- All kneel after _Sanctus_ finishes.

### Eucharistic Prayer through Great Amen
- [[Thurifer]] does incense.

- All line up on the _top step of the [[Presbytery]]_ for Communion, kneel together, stand and return to [[Choir Stalls#High]] after everyone has received.

### Ablutions
See [[Ablutions]], being mindful of [[Standby Formation#Considerations for the High Altar]]. The [[Altar Server|Servers]] should be in place in the [[Presbytery]] before the [[Minister|Ministers]] return.

- If the [[Celebrant]] leaves the [[Chalice Stack]] or other items in the center of the [[High Altar]], the [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] should leave them there. If he places them off to the side, the [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] should collect them and place them in the [[Presbytery#Niche]].

### Postcommunion Prayer through Recession
As for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass]], except:

- The [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Prayers at the Chair]] book instead of the [[Missal]].
- The [[Altar Server|Servers]] form up at the foot of the [[Presbytery]], instead of the foot of the [[Sanctuary]].
- Depending on the [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]] preference, either recess out the [[Passageway]] or West out of the [[Sanctuary]] and down the main aisle.
