## Overview
[[Roman Rite]] Solemn Mass celebrated at the [[Crossing Altar]]. These rubrics are used for the 12pm Sunday [[Mass]] at [[Saint Vincent Ferrer Church|SVF]], which is the "principal liturgy of the parish". Typically with one [[Deacon]], though sometimes there are zero or two[^deacon_thurifer] [[Deacon|Deacons]]. Typically with one [[Priest]] [[Celebrant]], though sometimes there are one or more [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]].

[^deacon_thurifer]: When there are two [[Deacon|Deacons]], it is proper for the second [[Deacon]] to perform the [[Incensation]] during the Eucharistic Prayer ([[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 179]]) instead of the [[Thurifer]]. We omit that rubric since we rarely have two [[Deacon|Deacons]], and most visiting [[Deacon|Deacons]] don't expect to do it.

## Roles
Four servers:

- [[Thurifer]]
- [[Crucifer]], [[Book Bearer]], [[Bell Ringer]]
- [[Acolyte]] 1, [[Lucifer]] 1
- [[Acolyte]] 2, [[Lucifer]] 2

## Preparation
- [ ] Candles:
	- [ ] [[Crossing Altar#Candles]] lit.
	- [ ] [[Sanctuary#Polychrome Candles]] lit.
	- [ ] [[High Altar#Candles]] lit, [[Vesperale]] present.
- [ ] [[Crossing Altar]]:
	- [ ] [[Crossing Altar#Crucifix]] present.
- [ ] [[Choir Stalls#Low]]:
	- [ ] [[Missal]] and [[Missal Stand|Stand]][^missal_location][^missal_pref].
	- [ ] [[Hand Bells]].
- [ ] [[Credence Table]]:
	- [ ] [[Chalice Stack]][^chalice_pref].
	- [ ] [[Cruets]].
	- [ ] [[Lavabo Dish]] and [[Finger Towel]].
	- [ ] [[Ciborium|Ciboria]].
	- [ ] [[Pyxe|Pyxes]] / [[Personal Chalice|Personal Chalices]]. People from the [[Congregation]] may place these on the [[Crossing Altar]], but they should be moved to the [[Credence Table]] before Mass starts.
	- [ ] Extra [[Burse]].
- [ ] [[Thurible Stand]] just outside [[Choir Stalls#Low]], with extra charcoal, tongs, and blowtorch.
	- [ ] [[Incense Boat]] filled before [[Mass]].
	- [ ] Charcoal lit shortly (10min) before [[Mass]].

[^missal_location]: See: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 118a]] specifies that this should be "next to the Priest's chair". However, this would complicate the [[Book Bearer]]'s actions. The wording is ambiguous enough that having it near the [[Altar Server|Server]] who will carry it seems allowed and is more practical.
[^missal_pref]: Unless [[Celebrant]] prefers to say the prayers at the [[Crossing Altar]].
[^chalice_pref]: Unless [[Celebrant]] prefers it to start on the [[Crossing Altar]].

## Order of Mass
Form up in [[Sacristy]], [[Pre-Mass Prayer with Ministers]].

### Introductory Rites

#### Entrance
- [[Thurifer]] helps [[Celebrant]] [[Imposition of Incense|Impose Incense]].
- An [[Altar Server]] rings the [[Entrance Bells]] one time.
- [[Procession#Long Cloister Walk Procession to Crossing Altar]].
- Form up at the foot of the [[Sanctuary]] and wait for the Processional Hymn to end and the Entrance Antiphon to begin.
- [[Altar Server|Altar Servers]] [[Reverence]][^entrance_genuflection] the [[Tabernacle]] together.
- [[Thurifer]] enters the [[Sanctuary]] on the left side of the [[Crossing Altar]] and enters [[Standby Formation]].
- [[Crucifer]] leads [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] into [[Sanctuary]] on the right side of the [[Crossing Altar]].
	- [[Crucifer]] deposits [[Processional Crucifix]] and goes to [[Choir Stalls#Low]].
	- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] return [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] to their spot against the wall behind the [[Ambo]][^processional_candle_location] and go to [[Choir Stalls#Low]].

[^entrance_genuflection]: See: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 49]].
[^processional_candle_location]: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 122]] specifies that [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] be put on or near the [[Altar]]. "Near" is ambiguous enough that where we put them should be allowed. Furthermore, the [[Crossing Altar]] has six candles already, and having more would not be allowed as per [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > 117]].

#### Reverence to the Altar
After the [[Celebrant]], [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]], and [[Deacon|Deacons]] reverence the [[Crossing Altar]]:

- [[Thurifer]] assists with the [[Imposition of Incense]], then waits in [[Standby Formation]] while the [[Celebrant]] incenses the [[Crossing Altar]][^first_incense].
- Others in [[Standby Formation]].
- When [[Celebrant]] is finished incensing, [[Thurifer]] retrieves [[Thurible]] and goes to [[Choir Stalls#Low]].

[^first_incense]: See: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 49, 123]].

#### Greeting, Penitential Act, Kyrie, Gloria
Wait in [[Choir Stalls#Low]]. According to [[Celebrant|Celebrant's]] preference, [[Book Bearer]] may hold the [[Missal]] for the [[Celebrant]] for all, part, or none of these parts. Usually, the [[Book Bearer]] is not needed until the [[#Collect]].

#### Collect
[[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Missal]][^book_bearing] for the [[Celebrant]]. After _Amen_, he returns to [[Choir Stalls#Low]], and all the [[Altar Server|Altar Servers]] sit together.

[^book_bearing]: See: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 189]].

### The Liturgy of the Word

#### First Reading, Gradual, Second Reading
Sit.

- [[Thurifer]] takes charged [[Thurible]] and lines up to the North of the [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] and West of the [[Credence Table]], facing South.
- After [[Deacon]] receives blessing[^alleluia_gospel_deacon], [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] proceed to the front of the [[Ambo]], and [[Thurifer]] leads [[Deacon]] to [[Ambo]][^gospel_procession][^alleluia_gospel_deacon][^gospel_book_location]. [[Book Bearer]] and anyone else in choir turns to face the [[Ambo]][^gospel_procession].
	- If there is no [[Deacon]], there is no blessing and the [[Altar Server|Servers]] lead the [[Celebrant]] or a [[Concelebrant]] after he reverences the [[Altar]].
	- Whomever is proclaiming the Gospel may wish to do so from the [[High Ambo]], in which case the [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] form up in front of that, and the [[Thurifer]] leads the [[Celebrant]] to the [[High Ambo]], letting him ascend the steps first.

[^gospel_procession]: See: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 133]].
[^alleluia_gospel_deacon]: See: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 175]].
[^gospel_book_location]: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 117, 122, 133, 172, 173, 175]] allow but do not require that the Book of the Gospels be placed on the [[Crossing Altar]], either at the beginning of Mass, or by the Deacon as part of the Procession.

#### Gospel
During Gospel:

- [[Thurifer]] assists with incensing the Book of the Gospels[^gospel_incense], then stands behind (diagonal, Northeast) the [[Ambo]] facing it with the [[Thurible]] while the Gospel is read.
- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] remain in place flanking the [[Ambo]] and facing inward.

[^gospel_incense]: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 134]].

- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]]:
	- Return and discreetly light the [[Torch|Torches]].

#### Sanctus
**Cue**: [[Schola Cantorum]] or [[Cantor]] intone the _Sanctus_.

- [[Thurifer#Charge at the Stand]]
	- If it is a short, chanted _Sanctus_, the [[Thurifer]] should act as quickly as possible without appearing to be rushed.
	- If it a long _Sanctus_, he may wish to delay charging the [[Thurible]], so that the incense lasts longer.
- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] retrieve [[Torch|Torches]] and line up in a pair behind the [[Ambo]], facing South.

- [[Thurifer]] incenses the [[Eucharist]] three times at each elevation[^consecration_incense], timing them with the rung bells. He performs a [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]] after each triplet of [[Incensation|Incensations]], synchronized with the [[Celebrant]]'s [[Genuflection]].
- [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] kneel in place holding [[Torch|Torches]], and do not perform [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]]s.

- If there is a Solemn Blessing, [[Book Bearer]] continues to bear book at chair.
- When finished, [[Book Bearer]] returns the [[Missal]] to the stand in [[Choir Stalls#Low]].

#### Recession

- [[Crucifer]] leads [[Altar Server|Servers]] to the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]] while [[Celebrant]] and [[Deacon]] kiss it.
- [[Crucifer]] and [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] line up with the front pews facing the [[Crossing Altar]], [[Crucifer]] in the middle. [[Thurifer]] lines up just in front of the [[Crucifer]] (between the [[Crucifer]] and the [[Crossing Altar]]).

[^recession_destination]: See [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 193]], which says that we should recess to the [[Sacristy]] along the route we used in procession. We don't do this so the [[Celebrant]] and [[Deacon]] can greet the people.
