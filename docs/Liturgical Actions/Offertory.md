The _Offertory_ is the part of [[Mass]] at which the [[High Altar|Altar]], bread, and wine are prepared for the Liturgy of the Eucharist.

## Roman Rite
In the [[Roman Rite]], the Offertory occurs immediately after the _Universal Prayer_, or the _Creed_ if the _Universal Prayer_ is omitted, or the _Homily_, if both are omitted.

### Overview
If there is an Offertory Chant, [[Altar Server|Servers]] with duties stand when it begins[^offertory_chant]. [[Altar Server|Servers]] work out of [[Standby Formation]][^which_altar]:
- [[Altar]] is prepared[^bring_to_altar].
- [[Chalice]] is prepared[^cruets][^people_bring_gifts].
- Bread and wine are offered by the [[Celebrant]].
- [[Altar]] is incensed[^offertory_incense].
- [[Lavabo]] is performed[^lavabo].

[^offertory_chant]: See: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 139]].
[^which_altar]: See [[Standby Formation]] for differences between the [[High Altar]] and [[Crossing Altar]].
[^bring_to_altar]: See: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 72, 178]]. Also, when a Deacon is not present, [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 139, 190]] specifically say that a lay minister moves the [[Chalice Stack]] to the altar, and that he places the [[Corporal]] and [[Purificator]], and [[Pall]]. (I would prefer we didn't do this). #liturgy-todo 
[^cruets]: See: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 142]].
[^people_bring_gifts]:  Some churches have the people bring up the gifts, but this is optional, see: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 73, 190]].
[^offertory_incense]: See: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 75, 144, 178, 190]].
[^lavabo]: See: [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal|GIRM > par. 76, 145]].

### If there is no Deacon
If there is no [[Deacon]], the [[Altar Server|Servers]] are responsible for all parts of the Offertory not performed by the [[Celebrant]].
1. Essential items are brought to the [[Altar]]:
	- [[Book Bearer]] brings the [[Missal]] and [[Missal Stand|Stand]], and places it center-left, at a 45-degree angle. His Offertory duties are finished, he returns to the [[Choir Stalls]]. He may wish to light the [[Torch|Torches]] to make duties easier for the [[Lucifer|Lucifers]].
	- [[Acolyte]] brings the [[Chalice Stack]] and places it on the Northeast corner of the [[Altar]], veil facing the people.
2. Other items brought to and taken from the [[Altar]]:
	- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] bring [[Ciborium|Ciboria]], [[Personal Chalice|Personal Chalices]], and [[Pyxe|Pyxes]], placing them on the Northeast corner of the [[High Altar|Altar]].
	- A [[Minister]] may place items on the Northeast corner of the [[Altar]] to indicate they should be taken away. [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] retrieve the items and return them to the [[Credence Table]]. This usually only applies to the [[Chalice Veil]] and extra [[Burse|Burses]].
3. The [[Celebrant]] offers the bread on the [[Paten]].
4. The [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] assist the [[Celebrant]] with preparing the [[Chalice]]:
	- The [[Acolyte]] on the right takes the wine [[Cruets|Cruet]], the one of the left takes the water [[Cruets|Cruet]]. Both wait in [[Standby Formation]].
	- **Cue**: The [[Celebrant]] [[Inclination|Bows]] after raising the bread.
	- The [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] approach in a pair, each holding one [[Cruets|Cruet]]. Wine on the right, water on the left. They offer the wine [[Cruets|Cruet]] first, then the water [[Cruets|Cruet]]:
		- Hold the [[Cruets|Cruet]] at an appropriate level so as to make it visible to the People and easily taken by the [[Celebrant]]. The handle should face the [[Celebrant]]. The caps of the [[Cruets]] should be removed at the [[Credence Table]] and left there.
	- After receiving the water [[Cruets|Cruet]] back, [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]] and return the [[Cruets]] to the [[Credence Table]].
5. The [[Thurifer]] assists with the [[Incensation]]:
	- **Cue**: [[Celebrant]] [[Inclination|Bows]] after raising the [[Chalice]].
	- [[Thurifer]] assists [[Celebrant]] in [[Imposition of Incense]], then returns [[Incense Boat]] and waits in [[Standby Formation]].
	- [[Celebrant]] incenses the [[Altar]].
	- **Cue**: [[Celebrant]] [[Inclination|Bows]] to the [[Altar]] after incensing it.
	- [[Thurifer]] retrieves [[Thurible]] from the [[Celebrant]] and stays in front of him.
	- [[Thurifer]] incenses the [[Celebrant]] three times, center, left, then right[^incense_direction].
	- If there are [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]], [[Thurifer]] incenses them in groups in the same manner.
	- [[Thurifer]] goes to the West side of the [[Crossing Altar]] and incenses the People in the same manner.
	- [[Thurifer]] returns [[Thurible]] to stand. His offertory duties are finished; he waits in [[Standby Formation]].
6. The [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] assist with the [[Lavabo]]:
	- **Cue**: The [[Celebrant]] has been incensed.
	- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] approach the [[Celebrant]] in a pair, right having the dish and water, left having the [[Finger Towel]].
	- [[Acolyte]] pours water over [[Celebrant]]'s fingers, the other offers the towel.
	- When [[Celebrant]] returns the towel, [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]] and return items to [[Credence Table]].
7. The [[Lucifer|Lucifers]] light the [[Torch|Torches]]. This can be done at any time, but should never delay the [[Acolyte|Acolytes]]' duties at the [[Altar]].
8. All return to [[Choir Stalls]].

[^incense_direction]: Center-left-right is the [[Roman Rite]] tradition. I think the #dominican [[Preservation of Dominican Customs|Custom]] is to do Center-center-center. Should we do that instead? #liturgy-todo.

### If there is a Deacon
If there is a [[Deacon]], he will perform some of the duties the [[Celebrant]] would in his absence, and some of the duties a [[Altar Server|Server]] would perform in his absence[^server_deacon_parts]. Notably:
- The [[Deacon]] brings the [[Chalice Stack]] to the [[Altar]] instead of an [[Acolyte]].
- The [[Deacon]] prepares the wine and water for the [[Chalice]] instead of the [[Celebrant]]. As a result:
	- The [[Cruets]] are brought to the [[Deacon]], not the [[Celebrant]].
	- The [[Chalice]] may be prepared _before_ the bread is offered by the [[Celebrant]]. The [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] must pay close attention to know when the [[Deacon]] needs the [[Cruets]].
- The [[Deacon]] incenses the [[Celebrant]], [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]], and People. The [[Thurifer]] assists with the [[Imposition of Incense]], waits in [[Standby Formation]], and then retrieves the [[Thurible]] from the [[Deacon]] after he has incensed the People.

### Sung and Low Mass
For [[Roman Rite Low Mass|Roman Rite Sung Mass]] and [[Roman Rite Low Mass]], the rubrics are identical, except:
- There is no [[Incensation]] of the [[Altar]], [[Celebrant]], [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]], and People. As a result, there is no [[Thurifer]].
- [[Torch|Torches]] are not used, so there is no need to light them.
- One [[Altar Server|Server]] must take on the role of both [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] and the [[Book Bearer]].
- The order is [[Chalice Stack]], [[Missal]], and then other items. The [[Celebrant]] or [[Deacon]] will likely take the [[Chalice Stack]], but if he does not the [[Acolyte]] should do so before the [[Missal]].
- One [[Acolyte]] must bring both [[Cruets]], he holds one in each hand.
- One [[Acolyte]] must perform the [[Lavabo]] alone, with the [[Finger Towel]] over his left arm, dish in his left hand, and pitcher/[[Cruets|Cruet]] in his right hand.

[^server_deacon_parts]: The [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] should pay attention even if a [[Deacon]] is present. For example, if the [[Deacon]] does not bring the [[Chalice Stack]] to the [[Altar]], the [[Acolyte]] should do it instead.
