## Sitting
- **Posture**: Stand up straight. Shoulders back. Head up.
- **Hands**: Flat, palms down on thighs.
- Face forward.
- When it will not cause a conspicuous delay, [[Altar Server|Servers]] should all sit/stand in sync.

## Standing
- **Posture**: Stand up straight. Shoulders back. Head up.

## Walking
- **Posture**: Stand up straight. Shoulders back. Head up.
- **Gait**: Solemn and stately.
- **Pace**: Appear neither to be rushed nor to tarry.
- **Hands**: Folded when standing or walking and not holding anything. Off hand over breast when holding something with one hand[^hands].
- **Reverse**: Avoid stepping backward, instead turning or rotating.
- **Bending**: When picking up something from the floor, for example [[Hand Bells]] during the Dominican Rite Mass, bring one knee to the ground to pick it up, rather than bending over.

[^hands]: See [[Dominican Ceremonial for Mass and Benediction|DCfMaB > p. 7]].

### When in pairs
- Walk close together and at the same pace.
- When turning around, turn inward, toward the other server.
- When turning left or right, turn as a unit.

## Head Bow
Perform a [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]] when the following is said at Mass:

- The name of Jesus.
- The name of Mary.
- If a Mass for a saint's feast, at that saint's name.

## Singing
When it is appropriate to sing, the server should do so. However, in the [[Sanctuary]] and especially when between the [[Schola Cantorum]] and the people, the [[Altar Server|Servers]] should sing in a quiet voice so as not to detract from the professional choir's voices.
