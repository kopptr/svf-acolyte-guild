There are no formal guidelines given in the [[The Roman Missal]] for the order of a [[Eucharistic Procession]]. The local [[Bishop]] has the authority to give guidelines. The [[Ceremonial of Bishops]] has a suggested order that includes a [[Bishop]] and his attendants.

## Order
The order of procession is:[^usage]

1. [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]], [[Crucifer]], [[Lucifer|Candle bearer]]
2. Banners
3. Religious in choir dress
4. [[Concelebrant|Concelebrants]] in [[Cope]]
5. [[Deacon|Deacons]]
6. Flower girls and their families
7. [[Thurifer|Thurifers]] and [[Boat Bearer]]
8. [[Canopy]] (four [[Canopy]] bearers), [[Priest]] with [[Monstrance]] under it, [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]]
	- If two [[Lucifer|Torch bearers]], flanking the [[Monstrance]] outside of the [[Canopy]].

9. [[Umbrellino Bearer]], extra [[Altar Server|Servers]]
10. [[Schola Cantorum]]
