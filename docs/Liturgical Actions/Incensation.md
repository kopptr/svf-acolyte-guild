We use the [[Preservation of Dominican Customs|Customary]] #dominican manner of incensation, which involves solemnly lifting and lowering the [[Thurible]], rather than swinging it as in the [[Roman Rite]].

### Incensing
The Dominicans developed their own technique for incensing things distinctive from the Roman Rite. Generally speaking, the Dominican technique involves solemnly raising and lowering the thurible vertically, and doing so straight ahead, whereas the Roman technique involves swinging the thurible, and often involves doing so at different angles.
