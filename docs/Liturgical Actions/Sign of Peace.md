## Roman Rite
If (and only if) the [[Celebrant]] or [[Deacon]] prompts it, give the sign of peace:
- [[Altar Server|Server]] closest to the [[Altar]] waits to see if [[Celebrant]] or [[Deacon]] bows to him. If so, head bow back.
- Then, that [[Altar Server|Server]] turns to the [[Altar Server|Server]] behind him, and they [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]] to one another. This second [[Altar Server|Server]] turns to the third and they [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]] to one another, and so on until the end.
- If prompted by a [[Lector]], bow to him.
