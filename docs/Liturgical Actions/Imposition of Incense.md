To _impose_ or _charge_ incense is to put incense in the [[Thurible]] while the coals are lit, or assist a [[Minister]] in doing so.

## At the Stand
With the [[Thurible]] on its [[Thurible Stand|Stand]], pull the ring and hook it on the [[Thurible Stand|Stand]]'s crucifix, so as to open the [[Thurible]]. Grab the [[Incense Boat]], kneel down on one knee, and scoop incense into the [[Thurible]], one hand holding the boat and the other hand holding the spoon. Stand, return the [[Incense Boat]] unless it's needed, move the ring so as to close the [[Thurible]], and then take the [[Thurible]].

## Celebrant
- Hand the boat to the [[Deacon]] if present, or to [[Celebrant]] if there is no [[Deacon]].
- Transfer the [[Thurible]] to the left hand.
- With right hand, pull the chain to open the [[Thurible]] about 6 inches. Grip the chain by squeezing your left hand.
- With right hand, raise the [[Thurible]] to the priest at the level of the [[Incense Boat]].
- [[Celebrant]] adds incenses and blesses it.
- Lower the [[Thurible]], close it, push down the choker ring.
- Return [[Thurible]] to right hand.
- Take [[Incense Boat]].
- Give [[Thurible]] to [[Deacon]] if present, or [[Celebrant]] if there is no [[Deacon]].
- [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]].

## Standing Self Charge
This is only used by the [[Thurifer]] during the [[Dominican Rite Solemn High Mass]].

- If [[Celebrant]] is present, present the first scoop of incense to him to bless.
