The _Epiclesis_ is the part of the [[Eucharistic Prayer]] where the Holy Spirit is called upon. The [[Bell Ringer]] rings the bell once at the _Epiclesis_.

## Words
See the [full text](https://catholic-resources.org/ChurchDocs/RM3-EP1-4.htm) for the Eucharist Prayers for the exact wordings of the _Epiclesis_ for the four usual Eucharistic Prayers. The table below gives the words leading up to the _Epiclesis_ for the first three Eucharistic Prayers, and then, in **bold**, the words of the _Epiclesis_ at which the [[Hand Bells]] should be rung.

| Eucharistic Prayer                                 | I                                                                                                                | II                                     | III                                                                                                  |

| Preceding words                  | ...and command that we be delivered from _eternal damnation_ and counted among the flock of those you have chosen. | ...the _fount of all holiness_.         | ...so that from the _rising of the sun to its setting_ a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name. |
| _Epiclesis_ | **Be pleased**, O God, we pray                                                                                   | **Make holy**, therefore, these gifts | **Therefore**, O Lord                                                                              |

## Other cues
In addition to knowing the words of the Epiclesis, one can tell the Epiclesis is being said because:
- The [[Celebrant]] will move both hands over the chalice.
- The [[Deacon]], if present, will kneel, possibly stepping away from the [[Altar]] first (this happens just _after_ the Epiclesis).

Frequently, these signals will either be hard to see or will happen too late. Therefore, it's best to have the words memorized.
