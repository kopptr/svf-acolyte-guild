## Manner of holding the Missal to be read
- [[Missal]] open.
- Top of binding against chest.
	- Try to hold at a height easy for the [[Celebrant]] to see. This will depend on both the height of the [[Celebrant]] and the [[Altar Server|Server]].
- Bottom of binding held with two hands.
	- Care should be taken not to block words with fingers or ribbon.
- Book held at about a 45 degree angle.

## Manner of opening the Missal
- Approach the [[Celebrant]], keeping the book closed, place the tip of the spine against the chest with the covers and pages protruding the to [[Celebrant]], and the bottom of the spine held with two hands.

	- If a [[Deacon]] (other than Deacon Powers) is present, approach the [[Deacon]] instead of the [[Celebrant]] to open to the correct page, then move in front of the [[Celebrant]].
