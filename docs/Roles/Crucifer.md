## Responsibilities
Attend to the [[Processional Crucifix]]:
- Bear the [[Processional Crucifix]] in [[Procession]]s.
- Place the [[Processional Crucifix]] in and retrieve it from its stand.

## Manner of holding the [[Processional Crucifix]]
- Hold with two hands during [[Procession]]s.
- During [[Inclination]]s and [[Genuflection]]s, only perform a [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]]. The idea is that Christ should bow to no one.
- Hold the [[Processional Crucifix]] as high as you can _while maintaining control of it_. Do not hold it so high so that it wobbles, or is not vertical, or is too difficult.
- It is occasionally acceptable to rest the [[Processional Crucifix]] on the ground and hold it with the right hand, keeping it vertical, and keeping the left hand on the breast, such as during stations in the [[Stations of the Cross]].

## The direction of the Corpus
We follow the #dominican [[Preservation of Dominican Customs|Custom]] of facing the Corpus toward the [[Celebrant]] in many circumstances:
- When [[Procession|processing]]:
	- If a bishop or Dominican is part of the procession, the corpus faces backward, so that the bishop or Dominican is walking toward Christ.
	- If there is no bishop or Dominican, the corpus faces forward, so that those in the [[Procession]] are following Christ's lead.
- When walking, not in a procession, the corpus faces forward.
- When standing in a place where the [[Celebrant]] can see the [[Processional Crucifix]], the Corpus faces the [[Celebrant]].
- When standing in place while the [[Celebrant]] is looking in the opposite direction, the Corpus should face the people.
