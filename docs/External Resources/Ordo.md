An _Ordo_ is a calendar that lists the details of liturgies for a particular liturgical year for a particular rite and jurisdiction. It is a useful reference material for liturgists, and [[Altar Server|Servers]] will find it useful as well.

For each day in a year, an Ordo contains specifications for solemnities/feasts/feria, readings, whether or not the _Credo_ and _Gloria_ are included, the liturgical color, and more.

## Roman Rite
In the Roman Rite there are separate calendars for the _Novus Ordo_ and _Traditional Latin Mass_. Since the latter is not celebrated at the [[Parish of St. Vincent Ferrer and St. Catherine of Siena|Parish]], we are only concerned with the former.

The [[Parish of St. Vincent Ferrer and St. Catherine of Siena|Parish]] operates in two jurisdictions, the [[Archdiocese of New York]] and the [[Province of St. Joseph]]. Typically we follow the second, though occasionally Masses will be increased in Solemnity if it is appropriate in the [[Archdiocese of New York]], such as how we celebrate what would be the Commemoration of St. Patrick as the Solemnity of St. Patrick, since he is the patron of the archdiocese.
