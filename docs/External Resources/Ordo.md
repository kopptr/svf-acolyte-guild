An _Ordo_ is a calendar that lists the details of liturgies for a particular liturgical year for a particular rite and jurisdiction. It is a useful reference material for liturgists, and [[Altar Server|Servers]] will find it useful as well.

For each day in a year, an Ordo contains specifications for solemnities/feasts/feria, readings, whether or not the _Credo_ and _Gloria_ are included, the liturgical color, and more.

In the Roman Rite there are separate calendars for the _Novus Ordo_ and _Traditional Latin Mass_. Since the latter is not celebrated at the [[Parish of St. Vincent Ferrer and St. Catherine of Siena|Parish]], we are only concerned with the former.

The [[Parish of St. Vincent Ferrer and St. Catherine of Siena|Parish]] operates in two jurisdictions, the [[Archdiocese of New York]] and the [[Province of St. Joseph]]. Typically we follow the second, though occasionally Masses will be increased in Solemnity if it is appropriate in the [[Archdiocese of New York]], such as how we celebrate what would be the Commemoration of St. Patrick as the Solemnity of St. Patrick, since he is the patron of the archdiocese. Furthermore, the masses in the [[Dominican Rite]] follows their own Ordo.
