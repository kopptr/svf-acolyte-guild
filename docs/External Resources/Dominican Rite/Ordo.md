An _Ordo_ is a calendar that lists the details of liturgies for a particular liturgical year. It is a useful reference material for liturgists, and [[Altar Server|Servers]] will find it useful as well. Need to know if a Saint's feast is skipped because it falls on a Sunday, or moved to the following Monday instead? Or if the Gloria or Creed is said for a particular feast? An _Ordo_ has this information.
