## General Conduct & Movement
- [[High Altar]] reverence is a [[Genuflection]] when entering/leaving the [[Sanctuary]], [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] otherwise.
- [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]] whenever giving/taking anything from a minister.

### Formations & Movement
- [[Approach Formation]]
- [[T-Formation]]
- [[Epistle and Gospel-side Formation]]
- [[Swing Movement]]
- [[Credo Formation]]
- [[Preface Formation]]

### Acolytes
- With a few exceptions, the [[Senior Acolyte]] is always assisting the [[Deacon]], and the [[Junior Acolyte]] is always assisting the [[Subdeacon]].
- All actions that take place on the [[High Altar|Altar]] by the Minister work as follows:
	- If coming from somewhere other than [[T-Formation]], first lead the Minister to [[Approach Formation]] and reverence the [[High Altar|Altar]].
	- While the Minister ascends, go around the [[High Altar|Altar]] to the Epistle side.
	- Perform your assistive action by partially ascending the [[High Altar|Altar]] from the Epistle side.
	- When finished:
		- If the minister will stay at the [[High Altar|Altar]], return to [[T-Formation]].
		- Otherwise, return to [[Approach Formation]], wait for the Minister, reverence the [[High Altar|Altar]], and then lead the Minister to his next destination.
- When [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] split to either side of the [[High Altar]], e.g. when stowing the [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]], they should take care to stay symmetrical. For example, if one [[Acolyte]] finishes first, he should wait for the other before returning to the foot of the [[High Altar]].
- Do not [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] when carrying [[Processional Candle|Processional Candles]] and flanking the [[Processional Crucifix]], CDR#p2c1a2p11. Do [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] when carrying [[Processional Candle]] and **not** flanking the [[Processional Crucifix]].

### Crucifer
- Corpus faces toward the Minister contemplating, or forward when not engaging with a Minister. Specifically:
	- Forward when walking (but not leading a procession), i.e. faces your destination.
	- Backward when leading a procession, i.e. those processing see the corpus.
	- Forward when standing for Gospel, i.e. the Gospel reader sees the corpus.
	- The celebrant during the [[#Credo]]. This means it will be carried facing sideways during the [[Swing Movement]] and [[Epistle and Gospel-side Formation|Gospel-side Formation]].
- Do not [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] when carrying [[Processional Crucifix]].

### Thurifer
- [[Thurifer]] must tend charcoals to make sure they are ready when incense is used.
- [[Thurifer]] will have to [[Imposition of Incense#Standing Self Charge]] during [[Mass]] while standing in [[T-Formation]], as well as before the [[#Peoples' Gospel]]. This is a tricky motion and should be practiced before Mass.

## Order of Mass
