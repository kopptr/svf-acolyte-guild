## Preparation
As [[Dominican Rite Solemn High Mass]], except:

- [ ] [[Humeral Veil]] starts on the [[High Altar]], between the [[Tabernacle]] and the [[Missal Stand]] on the Epistle Side (instead of in the [[Sacristy]]).
- [ ] The Book of the Gospels starts on the [[High Altar]], in the corner on the Gospel Side (instead of being carried by the [[Subdeacon]]).
