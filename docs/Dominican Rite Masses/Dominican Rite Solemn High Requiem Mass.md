## Overview
[[Dominican Rite Solemn High Mass]] at the [[High Altar]], with changes for a _Mass for the Dead_:

- No incense during Mass.
- There is no _Gloria_. The [[Chalice Stack]] is brought to the [[High Altar|Altar]] at the start of [[Mass]], rather than during the _Gloria_.
- There is no _Credo_.
- The priest does not give any blessings.

Typically, though optionally, Mass is followed by [[#Absolution at the Catafalque]]. If this is done:

- _Homily_ is omitted during Mass.
- Immediately following Mass, the [[Celebrant]] changes into a [[Cope]] in the [[Sacristy]], preaches a _Homily_, then returns to the [[Sacristy]].
- [[#Absolution at the Catafalque]] follows the preaching.

## Roles
- [[Senior Acolyte]].
- [[Junior Acolyte]].
- [[Crucifer]].
- [[Thurifer]], only if [[#Absolution at the Catafalque]] follows Mass.
- Extra [[Altar Server|Servers]] may sit in choir, vested. They may receive Communion with the core [[Altar Server|Servers]], and one may assist with the [[Paten]].
## Preparation
As [[Dominican Rite Solemn High Mass]], except:

- [ ] [[Humeral Veil]] starts on the [[High Altar]], between the [[Tabernacle]] and the [[Missal Stand]] on the Epistle Side (instead of in the [[Sacristy]]).
- [ ] The Book of the Gospels starts on the [[High Altar]], in the corner on the Gospel Side (instead of being carried by the [[Subdeacon]]).
- [ ] Incense is only prepared if [[#Absolution at the Catafalque]] follows Mass.
- [ ] If used, the [[Catafalque]] is set in place of the [[Crossing Altar]] and its candles.
