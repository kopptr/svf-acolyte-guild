Low [[Mass]] in the [[Dominican Rite]]. Typically celebrated at the [[Rosary Altar]].

## Roles
One server[^num_servers]: [[Book Bearer]], [[Acolyte]], [[Bell Ringer]].

[^num_servers]: [[Dominican Ceremonial for Mass and Benediction|DCfMaB > p. 14]].

## Preparation
- [ ] In [[Rosary Altar]] niche:
	- [ ] [[Cruets]].
	- [ ] Lavabo bowl.
	- [ ] Finger towel.
	- [ ] [[Paten]].
- [ ] On [[Rosary Altar]]:
	- [ ] [[Sanctus Candle]], just to the right of the rightmost [[Altar]] candle.
	- [ ] Three wooden prayer cards set out for [[Celebrant]].
	- [ ] [[Missal Stand]] on Epistle side.
	- [ ] The English hand missal, behind the [[Missal Stand]] and hanging off the side edge of the [[Altar]], so the [[Celebrant]] can easily grab it when the [[Missal]] is on the stand.
	- [ ] Two (not four) [[Rosary Altar]] candles lit[^candles].
- [ ] [[Hand Bells]] on first step to [[High Ambo]].
- [ ] [[Taper]] and stand on the steps where the [[Torch|Torches]] are stored.
- [ ] [[Rosary Altar]] gate closed.
- [ ] Prayer sheets at the foot of the [[Rosary Altar]], roughly 1/4 way in from the left side.

[^candles]: There are four candles on the altar, but two is the proper number to be lit for a Low Mass. Since we don't want those four candles to burn unevenly, we alternate using the inner candles and outer candles each Mass. Refer to the Mass's event description in the calendar to see which should be lit, or failing that, light whichever pair appears to be taller.

## Order of Mass

### Procession
Begin in [[Sacristy]] with [[Pre-Mass Prayer with Ministers]]:

- Carry [[Missal]].
- Use right hand to touch holy water, touch [[Celebrant]]'s hand to give him holy water.
- Ring bell on entering the sanctuary.
- Process until crossing the [[Tabernacle]], wait for [[Celebrant]] and [[Genuflection|Genuflect]] together[^entrance].
- Lead [[Celebrant]] to the right of the stand, down the center of the [[Sanctuary]], and then through the doorway to the [[Rosary Altar]].
- Step away from the [[Altar]] so the [[Celebrant]] can walk past you.
- When he does, move square to the Epistle side.

[^entrance]: [[Dominican Ceremonial for Mass and Benediction|DCfMaB > pp. 20-21]].

### Approach and Preparation of the Chalice
- [[Major Inclination|Profound Bow]] with [[Celebrant]][^entrance].
- Ascend [[Altar]] directly (as opposed to from the side) with [[Celebrant]] and place the [[Missal]] on its [[Missal Stand|Stand]], without opening it[^do_not_open_missal].
- Approach [[Rosary Altar#Niche]] and ready the [[Cruets]] for the [[Celebrant]] to prepare the [[Chalice]][^ready_chalice]:
	- [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]].
	- Offer wine from right hand. Switch water from left hand to right hand.
	- Receive wine in left hand.
	- [[Celebrant]] blesses the water:
		- Say **Benedicite**.
		- [[Celebrant]] says: _In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti_.
		- Say **Amen**.
	- Offer water from right hand. Switch wine from left hand to right hand.
	- [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]].
	- Return cruets to niche.
- Cross [[Altar]], [[Moderate Inclination|Moderate Bow]], kneel[^foot_kneel] square on Gospel side.

[^ready_chalice]: [[Dominican Ceremonial for Mass and Benediction|DCfMaB > pp. 22-23]].
[^do_not_open_missal]: [[Dominican Ceremonial for Mass and Benediction|DCfMaB > p.23, footnote 1]] forbids the [[Altar Server|Server]] from opening the [[Missal]].
[^foot_kneel]: [[Ceremonies of the Dominican Rite|CotDR > A1p4-5]].
### Prayers at the Foot of the Altar
- Hand the [[Celebrant]] his prayer sheet, remain kneeling.
	- During the prayers, kneel erect when the [[Celebrant]] is standing, bow while kneeling when the [[Celebrant]] is bowing.
- Sign of the Cross with the [[Celebrant]], reply **Amen**.
- Pray your parts on the prayer sheet[^foot_prayers].
	- Do not make the sign of the cross in the middle of the prayers where the [[Celebrant]] does.
- When finished, take the [[Celebrant]]'s prayer sheet, and place both on the step in front of you.
- [[Celebrant]] approaches [[Altar]], remain kneeling on the Gospel side.

[^foot_prayers]: [[Dominican Ceremonial for Mass and Benediction|DCfMaB > pp. 23-24]]. This notes that if the server does not have the prayer memorized, they should only be said once by the priest. It would be good for the server to memorize the prayers, but it is acceptable to use the prayer sheet like the [[Celebrant]] does.
### Introit through Alleluia/Tract
- Sign of the Cross with the [[Celebrant]], reply **Amen**.
- Remain kneeling through the _Introit_

### Kyrie
- With the [[Celebrant]], recite the [[Kyrie#Dominican Rite]] in the call-and-response form.

### Gloria
- The _Gloria_ is usually omitted. Consult the [[Ordo#Dominican Rite]] if you want to know beforehand if it will be said.
- If included, remain kneeling while the [[Celebrant]] says the _Gloria_.

### Collect
- _Dominus vobiscum_ | **et cum spiritu tuo**.
- Remain kneeling while the [[Celebrant]] reads the _Collect_.
- _Per omnia saecula saeculorum_ | **Amen**.

### Lesson, Responsorium, Epistle, Alleluia/Tract
- The particular liturgy will determine what is included in this portion of the Mass[^ordo].
	- There will be at least one _Lesson_[^lesson]. Most [[Celebrant]]s will read it in English.
	- The first _Lesson_ will be followed by the _Responsorium_, always in Latin.
	- On certain feasts and solemnities, one or more additional _Lessons_ will be read, and will be followed by a said _Alleluia_ (or in [[Lent]], a _Tract_).
- Remain kneeling for this portion of the Mass, making no response to any of the readings[^epistle].
- After the _Responsorium_ on ferial days, or at the start of _Alleluia_ / _Tract_ when it is said:
	- Stand, cross [[Altar]], [[Moderate Inclination|Moderate Bow]], stand square at Epistle side.
	- When [[Celebrant]] finishes and moves, approach from the side and grab [[Missal]] and [[Missal Stand|Stand]].
	- [[U Motion]] and place the [[Missal]] on Gospel side facing Northeast.
	- Move off to North side, face [[Missal]].

[^ordo]: Details for the Mass you are serving can be found in the [[OP Province of England Ordo]].
[^lesson]: According to the [Catholic Encyclopedia](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09193a.htm), the last lesson is always an Epistle.
[^epistle]: [[Ceremonies of the Dominican Rite|CotDR > A1p7]].

### Gospel
- _Dominus vobiscum_ | **et cum spiritu tuo**.
- _Sequentia/Initium Sancti Evangelii secundum N._ | **Gloria tibi Domine**[^gospel_response].
- With [[Celebrant]], three small crosses, one large sign of cross.
- At the first mention of _Jesus_ by the [[Celebrant]], [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]], descend [[Altar]], cross [[Altar]], [[Moderate Inclination|Moderate Bow]], stand at Epistle side **but face the Missal**.
- Sign of cross at end of Gospel, no verbal response.

[^gospel_response]: [[Dominican Ceremonial for Mass and Benediction|DCfMaB > p. 26]] has the [[Acolyte]] giving the response, which contradicts other sources.

### Homily
The Homily may be omitted for masses on ferial days, which include most of these masses.

- If there is no homily, face the [[Altar]] so as to be square on the Epistle side.
- If there is a _Homily_:
	- Wait for [[Celebrant]] to descend the [[Altar]] in the middle, then move to the doorway facing the [[Celebrant]] for the Homily.
	- When the _Homily_ is completed, you may need to assist the [[Celebrant]] with his [[Maniple]]. Ascend the [[Altar]] from the Epistle side, approach the [[Celebrant]], hold the [[Maniple]] open so he can put his arm through it. Depending on the particular [[Maniple]], clip it to the sleeve of his [[Alb]]. When finished, descend the [[Altar]] through the Epistle Side.
	- Stand square at the Epistle Side.

### Credo
The _Credo_ is usually omitted. If it is said, recite it with the [[Celebrant]] while standing square at the Epistle Side. Kneel on the [[Bottom Step]][^top_step] of the [[Altar]] as the [[Celebrant]] does for _Et incarnatus... factus est_.

[^top_step]: See [[Rosary Altar#Steps]].

### Offertory
- _Dominus vobiscum_ | **et cum spiritu tuo**.
- [[Celebrant]] reads the _Offertory Verse_ from the Gospel Side. Standby.
- [[Celebrant]] moves the [[Missal]] closer to the middle and begins to disassemble the [[Chalice Stack]]. Ascend to the [[Rosary Altar#Niche]] and ready the [[Lavabo]].
- Wash the [[Celebrant]]'s hands[^lavabo].
- Descend [[Altar]], stand square on Epistle side.

[^lavabo]: [[Dominican Ceremonial for Mass and Benediction|DCfMaB > p. 29]].

### Orate Fratres through Preface
- Respond, [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]] at _Domino Deo_.
	- _per omnia saecula saeculorum_ | **Amen**
	- _Dominus vobiscum_ | **et cum spiritu tuo**
	- _Sursum corda_ | **Habémus ad Dóminum**
	- _Grátias agámus Dómino Deo nostro_ | **Dignum et justum est**
- Pick up the [[Hand Bells]] before the [[Sanctus]]. A helpful cue is the [[Celebrant]] talking about angels (_Angeli_ / _Seraphim_).

### Sanctus
As the [[Celebrant]] begins the [[Sanctus]]:

- Profound bow and make three[^sanctus] short rings. Do not try to synchronize to the [[Celebrant]]'s three utterances, just make short, distinct, rings after the first _Sanctus_.
- Recite the [[Sanctus#Latin Text]] with the [[Celebrant]].
- Set down bells, get [[Taper]], light [[Sanctus Candle]], return [[Taper]].
- Retrieve [[Hand Bells]] and kneel on the [[Top Step]][^top_step] on the Epistle side.

[^sanctus]: [[Ceremonies of the Dominican Rite|CotDR > a1p10]] makes no mention of how many times it should be rung.

### Eucharistic Prayer
- Perform one short bell ring at the _Epiclesis_[^epiclesis]
	- **Cue**: The [[Celebrant]] makes 5 signs of the cross over the [[Altar]]'s contents.
- Then immediately stand, descend [[Altar]] to middle, [[Moderate Inclination|Moderate Bow]], then kneel on [[Top Step]] just to the right of the [[Celebrant]], keeping the bells.
- First elevation:
	- First short bell when [[Celebrant]]'s knee hits the floor. At this point also grab the [[Chasuble]].[^elevation]
	- Lift the [[Celebrant]]'s [[Chasuble]] as he's lifting the Eucharist.
	- Second short bell at the apex of the elevation.
	- Lower the [[Celebrant]]'s [[Chasuble]] as he's lowering the Eucharist.
	- Third short bell when [[Celebrant]]'s knee hits the floor.
- Second elevation: Same as first.
- Immediately following second elevation, stand, descend [[Altar]] to middle, **[[Genuflection|Genuflect]]**[^genuflection], then return the [[Hand Bells]] and kneel square on the Epistle side.
- _Per omnia saecula saeculorum_ | **Amen**.
- Stand[^standing].

[^epiclesis]: [[Ceremonies of the Dominican Rite|CotDR > a1p10]] makes no mention of an epiclesis bell ring, but Fr. Leo said to include it.
[^elevation]: [[Ceremonies of the Dominican Rite|CotDR > a1p10]] makes no mention of the first and third rings, only the second.
[^genuflection]: [[Ceremonies of the Dominican Rite|CotDR > a1p5]] says this should be a moderate bow.
[^standing]:  [[Ceremonies of the Dominican Rite|CotDR > a1p5]] doesn't mention this as a reason to stand. Furthermore [[Ceremonies of the Dominican Rite|CotDR > a1p10-11]] does not mention standing at this point.

### Pater Noster through Priest's Communion
- Standing, stay silent until end of Pater Noster
	- _...et ne nos indúcas in tentatiónem_ | **sed libera nos a malo**
- _Per omnia saecula saeculorum_ | **Amen**.
- _Pax Domini sit semper vobiscum_ | __et cum spiritu tuo__.
	- While this is being said, ready the [[Hand Bells]].
- When the [[Celebrant]] starts the recitation of the _Agnus Dei_, recite the [[Agnus Dei#Latin Text]] with him. While doing so:
	- Ring the [[Hand Bells]] once[^agnus_dei], then return them.
	- Ascend to the niche, retrieve the [[Paten]], and face the [[Altar]]. After the _Agnus Dei_, kneel on the South side facing North.
- Kneel in place for the [[Priest]]'s Communion.

[^agnus_dei]: Only ring the bell if there are people in the congregation. If serving a private mass or no one has showed up, do not ring the bell.

### Peoples' Communion
If Communion will be distributed to the people[^peoples_communion], which is the norm:

- Recite [[Domine non sum Dignus#Latin Text]] three times with the [[Celebrant]].
- Receive Communion, holding the [[Paten]][^cloth] for yourself and not making a response.
- Immediately stand and descend the [[Altar]], leading the [[Celebrant]] so as to assist with Communion[^paten] on his right while facing the people. While there are still communicants:
	- Hold the [[Paten]] under the communicant's chin
	- Step backward to the next communicant.
	- When you get the the end, follow the [[Celebrant]] to the beginning.
- Give [[Paten]] to [[Celebrant]].
- If there are leftover hosts, the [[Celebrant]] may return them to the [[Tabernacle]] in the [[High Altar]]. Just stand out of the way and wait.

[^peoples_communion]: [[Dominican Ceremonial for Mass and Benediction|DCfMaB > pp. 70-73]].
[^cloth]: [[Ceremonies of the Dominican Rite|CotDR > a1p11]] says a cloth should be used instead of a [[Paten]].
[^paten]: [[Ceremonies of the Dominican Rite|CotDR > a1p11]] makes no mention of this.

### Ablutions
- Wait for [[Celebrant]] to ascend [[Altar]].
- Go to center, [[Moderate Inclination|Moderate Bow]], ascend to the niche.
- Wait for [[Celebrant]] to set [[Paten]] to the side. When he does, retrieve it and return it to the niche.
- From niche, prepare for ablutions by holding _both_ water and wine [[Cruets]].
- First ablution, only wine[^ablutions]. Pour until [[Celebrant]] lifts the chalice. [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]].
- Second ablution. Pour just a little wine until [[Celebrant]] raises chalice. Then water (much more) until [[Celebrant]] raises chalice. [[Minor Inclination|Head Bow]].
- There may be additional vessels / [[Pyxe|Pyxes]] that need purification. [[Celebrant]] will indicate if so and these will only take water.
- Return [[Cruets]].

[^ablutions]: [[Dominican Ceremonial for Mass and Benediction|DCfMaB > pp. 44-45]].

### Postcommunion Verse, Postcommunion Prayer, and Last Gospel
- Descend, cross [[Altar]], [[Moderate Inclination|Moderate Bow]], approach and ascend from the North. Take [[Missal]] and [[Missal Stand|Stand]].
- [[U Motion]], [[Moderate Inclination|Moderate Bow]], ascend and place [[Missal]] and [[Missal Stand|Stand]] square on the Epistle side[^move_missal].
- Descend, get [[Taper]], extinguish [[Sanctus Candle]], return [[Taper]].
- Cross [[Altar]], [[Moderate Inclination|Moderate Bow]], stand square at Gospel side[^postablution].

[^move_missal]: [[Dominican Ceremonial for Mass and Benediction|DCfMaB > p. 45]].
[^postablution]: [[Ceremonies of the Dominican Rite|CotDR > a1p12]] says to kneel instead of stand.
[^ite_missa_est]: [[Dominican Ceremonial for Mass and Benediction|DCfMaB > pp. 45-46]] states that this is only said if the _Gloria_ was said earlier, however we seem to do it regardless. The [[Altar Server|Server]] should respond to _Ite missa est_ if the [[Celebrant]] recites it.

### Prayers After Mass and Recession
- If there are post-Mass prayers[^postmass_prayers].
	- Stay standing square to Gospel side while [[Celebrant]] descends.
	- Kneel with [[Celebrant]] on the [[Bottom Step]][^top_step] of the [[Altar]], respond to prayers, stand with [[Celebrant]].
	- Stay in place while [[Celebrant]] ascends the [[Altar]].
