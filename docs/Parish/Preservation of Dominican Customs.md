At [[Saint Vincent Ferrer Church|SVF]], we preserve the customs of the Dominican Order and, where allowed, incorporate them into the liturgies of the [[Roman Rite]]. For example, we celebrate Dominican saints' feast days with greater solemnity, repeat "Holy Father Dominic" in our public prayer of the _Litany of the Saints_, and the Friars reverence the [[Veneration Crucifix]] in a manner customary to the Dominicans during the [[Good Friday]] liturgy.

This [[index|Handbook]] uses the #dominican tag to indicate where a rubric or practice comes from a Dominican practice.
