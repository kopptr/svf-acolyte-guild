The focal point of church, the large, central altar housing the main [[Tabernacle]].

## Candles
Six tall candles on the altar, three on either side of the [[Tabernacle]].

## Angel Candles
Two candles held by angel statues, outside of the altar [[#Candles]]. These are lit only on certain occasions.

## Predella
The platform where the [[Celebrant]] stands when celebrating [[Mass]].

## Gradine
"Gradine" refers to a shelf above the altar on which flowers and candlesticks are placed. The High Altar at [[Saint Vincent Ferrer Church|SVF]] lacks a Gradine, so such items are placed to the back of the altar.
