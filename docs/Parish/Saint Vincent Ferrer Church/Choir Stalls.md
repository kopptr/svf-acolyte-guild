The choir stalls are the wooden seats in the [[Sanctuary]] that face inward. It is divided into four sections:
- Northeast
- Northwest
- Southwest
- Southeast

Each section has two rows with individual seats, and one row which is closest to the center of the [[Sanctuary]] and has a bench.

## Low
The bench seats on the West side of the Northwest section. This is where the servers sit during Masses at the [[Crossing Altar]] and where the [[Book Bearer]] sits during most of a [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]].

## High
The individual seats on the East side of the Southeast section. These seats are closest to the [[Passageway]]. This is where most servers sit during [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]], and where the [[Crucifer]] and [[Thurifer]] sit during [[Dominican Rite Solemn High Mass]].
