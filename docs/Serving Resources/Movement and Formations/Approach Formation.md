## Usage
Approach formation is used in the [[Dominican Rite Solemn High Mass]] whenever a group of Ministers/[[Altar Server|Servers]] is approaching or leaving the [[High Altar]] in the [[Presbytery]].

## Form
- Ministers and [[Acolyte]]s stand in a row parallel to and facing the [[High Altar]].
- When all are present:
	- At foot of [[High Altar]], from left to right: [[Junior Acolyte]], [[Subdeacon]], [[Celebrant]], [[Deacon]], [[Senior Acolyte]].
	- Behind them, in the middle: [[Crucifer]].
	- Behind him, in the middle: [[Thurifer]].
- Use squares for spacing.
- When [[Crucifer]] / [[Thurifer]] are not present, it's just a line.
- When two are missing, e.g. during the Epistle, line up in spaces as if they were there.
- When only one [[Acolyte]] / Minister pair is present, Minister is in the middle, and [[Acolyte]] can be on either side. [[Acolyte]] chooses the side based on what moves most smoothly, typically left if having just led the Minister to the [[High Altar]] from the Epistle side, right if next movement is to the Epistle side.
