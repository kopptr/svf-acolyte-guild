[[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar#Order of Mass]], except:

- Immediately following the _Homily_, the [[#Blessing and Imposition of Ashes]].
- Preparations for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament]] during the [[Ablutions]].

### Procession
[[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar#Procession]].

### Collect
The _Penitential Rite_ and [[Kyrie]] are omitted (and there is no [[Gloria]] since it is [[Lent]]), so after the [[High Altar]] is incense the [[Book Bearer]] immediately attends with the [[Prayers at the Chair]] book for the [[Collect]].

### First Reading through Homily
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]].

### Blessing and Imposition of Ashes
- The [[Book Bearer]] approaches the [[Celebrant]] with the [[Prayers at the Chair]] book, the [[Celebrant]] says the blessing. The [[Book Bearer]] places the [[Prayers at the Chair]] book on the [[Choir Stalls]] and lines up to receive ashes.
- As the [[Celebrant]] sprinkles the ashes with Holy Water, the other [[Altar Server|Servers]] line up for ashes with the [[Book Bearer]].
- After receiving ashes, the [[Altar Server|Servers]] return to [[Choir Stalls#High]].
- The [[Minister|Ministers]] impose ashes on the people. Upon their return, the [[Crucifer]] assists with cleaning their hands as needed.

### Offertory through Peoples' Communion
As usual for [[Roman Rite Solemn Mass at the High Altar]]. The [[Credo]] is not said, and the [[Universal Prayer]] is omitted.

### Ablutions
- [[Acolyte|Acolytes]] perform [[Ablutions#High Altar]]. If the [[Book Bearer]] is occupied, an [[Acolyte]] retrieves the [[Missal]] when appropriate.
- [[Crucifer]] and [[Thurifer]] prepare [[Crossing Altar]] for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament]]:
	- [[Crossing Altar#Candles]] lit.
	- [[Candelabra|Candelabrae]] lit and in place.
	- [[Corporal]], [[Thabor]], and [[Monstrance]].
	- Move [[Aspersorium]] to [[Rosary Altar#Niche]]
	- Move [[Thurible Stand]] to foot of [[Crossing Altar]] on Epistle Side. Add coals.
- When finished, all return to [[Choir Stalls#High]].

### Postcommunion prayer and transition
- The [[Book Bearer]] holds the [[Prayers at the Chair]] book. The [[Thurifer]] stands by next to the [[Celebrant]] facing North.
- When finished, the [[Book Bearer]] returns to [[Choir Stalls#High]], the [[Thurifer]] precedes the [[Celebrant]] to the foot of the [[Crossing Altar]], as at [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Transition]].

## Exposition
- [[Thurifer]] acts as usual for [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]], starting from [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament#Incensation]].
- Other [[Altar Server|Servers]] standby in the [[Choir Stalls]], kneeling as appropriate.
- When [[Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament|Exposition]] is finished, the [[Thurifer]] precedes the [[Celebrant]] out of the church through the [[Lourde's Door]].
- The other [[Altar Server|Servers]] discreetly [[Reverence]] the exposed Eucharist and exist to the [[Sacristy]] through the [[Passageway]].

## Benediction
After the Holy Hour, a [[Altar Server|Server]] acts as [[Thurifer]] for [[Benediction]], as usual.
