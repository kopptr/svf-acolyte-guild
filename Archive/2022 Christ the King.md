## Mass

### Entrance Procession
- Route:
	- Enter in normal sacristy door
	- Walk between frontmost pews and rail
	- Walk toward Lex between pews (not hugging Confessional wall)
	- Turn right at back of church (do not enter vestibule)
	- Turn right up center aisle
	- Go straight into sanctuary
- **Thurifer 1**: Wait at the foot of the Sanctuary until the Processional Hymn is finished and the Entrance Antiphon begins.

### Mass Proper
As normal at the high altar. Notably:
- Crozier-bearer, Mitre-bearer, and Book-bearer attend to the Cardinal under direction from the MC.
- The Missal and stand will stay on the altar, Book-bearer holds the Prayers at the Chair book instead of the Missal.
#### Gospel
- Thurifer should start moving to ready the incense before Alleluia, as there is much more distance to cover.
- Fr. Peter Martyr will read the Gospel from the high pulpit, escorted by Thurifer (but no candle-bearers).
- Cardinal Burke will give the homily, possibly escorted by Crozier-bearer and Mitre-bearer under direction of the MC, possibly to the high pulpit.
#### Preparation, Consecration, Communion
- Candle-bearers prepare the altar as normal. Thurifer gives incense as normal. Thurifer incenses concelebrants and people as normal.
- At consecration, the order from left to right is: Torch, Candle, Thurifer, Crucifer (with boat), Candle, Torch.
	- This will be at the first step of the High Altar, unless there are too many concelebrants, in which case it will be at the first step of the Presbyterium.
	- Crucifer charges incense if needed.
	- James will get the bells.
- Torch-bearers hold patens at rails at Friars' chapel and Rosary altar

#### Ablutions
- Torch bearers return patents to priest, who takes it to the altar. Then they approach the Cardinal with the metal Lavabo and a fresh towel, waist bow, wash his hands, waist bow. Kneel to the Cardinal if he is seated.
- Candle-bearers handle the ablutions from the right side as is normal at the High Altar.
- Crucifer moves the kneeler to the base of the High Altar
- Crucifer and book-bearer bring the cope from the sedilia to the Cardinal, and with the MC help him vest.
- Crucifer takes the chasuble and places it on the sedelia.

### Exposition
After the ablutions the Cardinal will expose the Eucharist in the monstrance. Then:
- Book-bearer holds book for prayer after communion (unless Cardinal prefers to read from the Missal at the High Altar)
	- Thurifers and boat-bearer go to walkway
		- Thurifers add extra charcoal
		- Boat-bearer loads his pockets with charcoal bag
- _O Salutaris_ starts
	- Crucifer and candle-bearers line up in Presbyterium (or Sanctuary, if too crowded) to lead impending Procession (should this happen after the Consecration Prayer?)
- Cardinal leads consecration prayer to Christ the King
- The book-bearer (Or should it be a concelebrant?) helps the Cardinal don the Humeral Veil
	- Thurifers charge thuribles with (lots) of incense from the smaller boat
- Crucifer leads the procession out

## Procession
### Order
- Crucifer & Candle-bearer 2
- Friars & concelebrants  
- Mitre-bearer & Crozier-bearer & Book/Ombrellino-bearer (MC will likely not process)
- Thurifer 1 & Boat-bearer & Thurifer 2
- Monstrance & Canopy
- Attending priests in copes (these will take shifts carrying the monstrance during the procession)
- Sisters and other religious
- Choir & Brass quartet

### Beginning
- The Cardinal gets the monstrance, procession starts
	- When he turns, Crucifer turns and lead (we don't genuflect to the High Altar because we're processing).
	- Friars and concelebrants form up and follow
	- When there is space at the foot of the Presbyterium, thurifers and boat-bearer line up at the foot of it.
	- When all friars and concelebrants are processing, Mitre-bearer and Crozier-bearer go next
	- Thurifers go next. (Do both face forward at this time or do they do the forward/backward walk thing here?)
	- Monstrance / umbrellino go next
	- Others fill an afterwards

### Route
- Presbyterium / Sanctuary
- Down the center aisle, enter the vestibule
- Turn right and exit the 66th st door
- Turn left down 66th St.
- Turn left down 5th Ave.
- Turn left into St. Patrick's
- Process up Center aisle to altar

### Timing
- **Crucifer** sets pace. The goal is for the procession to take ~1 hour. 2:45pm is the latest we should arrive at St. Patrick's, as they have a concert at 3:15pm.

## Benediction
- Crucifer and candle-bearers stand off to the side
- Mitre-bearer and Crozier-bearer attend to Cardinal
- Thurifers lead Eucharist to altar, and then kneel at foot with boat-bearer for Benediction
- Other servers stand off to the side of the choir stalls
